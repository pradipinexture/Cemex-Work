The desk was conceived in partnership with CEMEX and incorporates cutting edge developments in concrete.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have recently moved into new offices at the White Collar Factory, a cutting edge office building in terms of its approach to sustainability and modern office design. There is a lot of exposed concrete, polished finished pillars and timber slats in formwork showing exemplar work in traditional concrete construction approaches. <br> <br> \u201cWithin these surroundings we wanted visitors to get a feeling of innovation, experimental, and cutting edge material use, reflecting our approach to design, combining tradition with innovation to maximise a material\u2019s potential. <\/p> <p>\u201cThe reception desk showcases what high performance concrete can do and how fabric formwork can be used in shape generation and high quality exposed finishes- it combines function, innovation in material and fabrication and performance as a traditional desk space. It\u2019s a working area but a stylish working area,\u201d comments Ed Moseley, Design Director AKTII. <br> <br> The project originated after executives from AKT II were introduced to the concrete technology developed by the CEMEX Global R&D team, located in Switzerland. The inspiration behind the co-created design of the desk, was drawn from the versatility and malleability of the material, together with the modern ambience already set in the AKT II offices. <\/p> <p>\u201cCollaborating with AKT II on this project, gave us the opportunity to push the boundaries of the innovative technologies we have been developing. We were able to present concrete in a new light and explore new fabrication techniques that, when combined together, produced an element in which one would not expect to find such material,\u201d stated Davide Zampini, Head of CEMEX Global R&D.<br> <br> The reception desk uses ultra-high-performance concrete with fibre reinforcement which enables it to have fluid curves and embedded texture. Lightweight concrete and water-repellent technology were also used in the creation of the desk. <br> <br> This everyday piece of furniture makes a unique statement and highlights the amazing possibilities of the world\u2019s most consumed manmade product. <\/p> <p>AKTII is a London-based firm of structural and civil engineering consultants. CEMEX R&D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland. <\/p> <p>-Ends-<br> <br> For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a>Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t: 01932 583214. <\/p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>More high resolution photographs of different aspects of the reception desk are available<\/li><li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/li><li><strong>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 <\/strong>CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.<\/li><li><strong>About CEMEX: <\/strong>CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

The demanding target of 1000 hectares was set for the year 2020, but has just been reached with the 1000<sup>th<\/sup> hectare created at Hopwas Quarry, near Tamworth in the West Midlands. 　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Andy Spencer, Director of Sustainability, CEMEX UK comments: \u201cThe partnership with the RSPB has enabled us to enhance the natural environment surrounding our operations. While supplying our customers with concrete, cement, sand and stone we also aim to balance the needs of operations with the protection and enhancement of the natural world. The RSPB has been pivotal in helping us achieve this aim. 　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">\u201cThe 1000<sup>th<\/sup> hectare that has just been created is a significant and outstanding milestone and our partnership to date has helped create some amazing places for communities and nature,\u201d he concludes.　<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">This is endorsed by Mike Clarke, Chief Executive RSPB \u201cOur nature is in trouble and we need to be creating habitats to reverse the population declines we have seen in many species, some of which are in danger of disappearing entirely.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">\u201cWorking in partnership with CEMEX we have seen how land can be transformed from being an operational site or exhausted quarry into a vibrant home for wildlife. These new much needed habitats are attracting and becoming home to wildlife including threatened species. They are also offering fantastic amenities for local communities and nature lovers. 　<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">\u201cThe successes we are seeing are great examples of how conservationists and businesses can come together to create something special for wildlife and future generations to enjoy.\u201d　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">The 1000<sup>th<\/sup> hectare was created at Hopwas quarry, an exhausted sand and gravel quarry. Heather cuttings containing seeds and other flora from an adjoining Site of Scientific Interest (SSSI) site has been spread over part of the site.  This will encourage and help create heathland, typical of the surrounding area.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">The first hectare to benefit from the partnership in 2010 was Eversley Quarry in Hampshire where, over the years, a mosaic of different habitats has been created alongside community sports facilities.  The latest project includes the creation of reed beds to encourage Bitterns, which currently have a small population of around 80 breeding pairs in the UK.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Other quarry sites that have made a significant contribution to nature include Southam in Warwickshire with a dedicated area of sparse wasteland for the Small Blue Butterfly, Dove Holes in Derbyshire where a meadow has been planted with a flower rich mix including sorrel for the Twite bird and Cambusmore in Scotland, with its rich grasslands and open waters, the perfect environment for wildfowl and birds of prey.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">-Ends-　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\"> <\/p>\n<b><p dir=\"LTR\">Notes to editors:　<\/p>\n<\/b><p dir=\"LTR\">For further CEMEX information contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/span><\/a> t: 01932 583214 　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">For further RSPB information contact Gareth Brede, RSPB senior media officer: 01767 693221 / <a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">gareth.brede@rspb.org.uk<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<ul><li dir=\"LTR\">\u201cThe story of the 1000 hectares\u201d video can be found on YouTube http://cmx.to/2xXPcw1　\n<\/li><li dir=\"LTR\">More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website <a href=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">www.cemex.co.uk<\/span><\/a>\n<\/li><li dir=\"LTR\">Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.

Three nest holes have been seen in the quarry\u2019s sandy bank.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Yesterday afternoon (19 July) RSPB wardens watching the nests noticed parent birds flying to and from one of the nest holes with food, indicating that young were being fed. The other two nests are now also on the verge of hatching and the RSPB expects all three will have young by the weekend. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Bee-eaters are rare visitors to the UK. Before the Millennium they had only appeared twice, but have since nested in Cumbria (2015), the Isle of Wight (2014), Herefordshire (2005) and Country Durham (2002). It is thought they are expanding their range north due to climate change.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Mark Thomas, RSPB Senior Investigations Officer, said: \u201cThese exotic birds \u2013 a kaleidoscope of greens, yellows, reds and blues \u2013 are much more likely to be seen in southern Europe or Africa rather than Nottinghamshire. But we\u2019re delighted to see bee-eaters return to nest in the UK once more; a very rare occurrence that has wildlife enthusiasts very excited.\u201d <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Around 10,000 people are thought to have seen the Nottinghamshire bee-eaters, some travelling from as far afield as Cornwall and County Durham.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As their name suggests, bee-eaters feed predominately on bees and other flying insects like wasps and dragonflies. After catching a bee, the birds will toss it into the air or strike the bee against a branch to remove the string, rendering it safe to swallow.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Mark added: \u201cBee-eaters are sociable birds and nest together in small groups. Often pairs will enlist the help of a single, younger bird to help bring food and rear their chicks. Bringing up baby is very much a community effort.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cIn recent years, bee-eater sightings have been on the increase. We believe the birds are being pushed northwards due to climate change, so are likely to become more established visitors to the UK in the future. And, thanks to this partnership with CEMEX, we can provide that right habitat for them.\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Bee-eaters and nest in burrows that reach up to 10ft (3m) often in sand banks, in which they lay 3-8 white eggs. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Andy Spencer, Sustainability Director at CEMEX, said: \u201cWorking quarries like this one offer the perfect home for bee-eaters and other birds like sand martins. On CEMEX quarry sites we build dedicated sand piles away from the operations where birds can make their nests and breed without interruption. We\u2019re delighted to be hosting these charming visitors for the duration of their stay in the UK.\"  <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Because the birds are so rare, round-the-clock protection was necessary to ensure the birds and their nests were not disturbed. Working closely with CEMEX, the RSPB deployed wardens to monitor the site day and night to ensure the safety of both birds and birdwatchers. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Mark Thomas explained: \u201cBy day, the nests were at risk from egg collectors, and by night the eggs \u2013 and now the chicks \u2013 are at risk of being taken by a fox. Fox prints were seen in the sand, so we posted wardens armed with torches on night watch to deter any predators that might be on the prowl. Sure enough, one night, a fox appeared near the nests, but was scared away by the torchlight. If we hadn\u2019t been present, it would almost certainly have got the chicks.\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The nestlings are expected to fledge around mid-August, giving birdwatchers a chance to see them before the colony flies back to their southern territories.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>To visit the bee-eaters, go to Ashby Road, East Leake, Notts LE12 6RG.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>More: <\/p><p><ahref=\"https:>https://www.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/biodiversity/archive/2017/06/26/how-to-see-bee-eaters-in-nottinghamshire.aspx<\/ahref=\"https:><\/p><p> <\/p><p> -Ends-<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young on 01932 583214 or email <\/p><p><a>Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a><\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Photographs, video and interviews:<\/p><p> <\/p><p>For further images, video or to arrange an ISDN broadcast-quality radio interview please contact Harry Bellew, RSPB.<\/p><p>Image Credit: Jeff Rose <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Editor\u2019s notes:<\/p><p> <\/p>The RSPB is the UK\u2019s largest nature conservation charity, inspiring everyone to give nature a home.

The compelling Quarry Garden narrative captured the RHS judges\u2019 imagination. The garden is divided into three zones; a floriferous and naturalistic area featuring slate monoliths, wild flowers and plants often associated with former extraction sites, moving through to an open, modernist sunken concrete pool and finally a structured paved area bordered by a sculptural artwork.<\/p><p>Paul Hervey-Brookes explains: \u201cThe garden design is an expression of how nature and extraction sits comfortably alongside each other. It features mass produced products manufactured from extracted materials, natural slate, concrete and steel, as well as hard landscaping materials made from recycled and reclaimed materials. I\u2019m very proud of what we have achieved and I\u2019m delighted that this has been recognised by the RHS.\u201d<\/p> <p>CEMEX UK is supporting the project and has provided concrete for the amazing concrete \u2018pit\u2019 and precast blocks for the two concrete walls. The \u2018pit\u2019 is a water feature that resembles the benches of a working quarry.  Four colleagues from the Aggregates business are helping \u2018man\u2019 the garden during the show.<\/p> <p>Miles Watkins, President,  Institute of Quarrying, says: \u201cThis is a wonderful way to mark one hundred years of IQ. Taking on a show garden is a major undertaking and to receive Best in Show and a Gold Medal is recognition of all the hard work and endeavour that has gone into making it a reality. That includes the superb project management undertaken by the team at IQ and the dedication of our garden designer and his build team, as well as the support that the project has received from across the sector.\u201d<br>  <br> The project has been an inclusive process throughout. Students from Nottingham Trent University\u2019s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Science were influential in the initial design concepts of the garden and join young leaders from Aggregate Industries, Cemex, Hanson and Tarmac as garden ambassadors during the week of RHS Chatsworth.<br>  <br> At 480m<sup>2<\/sup> the Quarry Garden is one the largest RHS show gardens ever.

The increased visibility with the standard safety features has done much to ensure that drivers can see cyclists and pedestrians and prevent incidents.<\/p> <p>David Hart, UK Supply Chain Director comments \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be expanding the number of low entry cab vehicles in our fleet.  This type of vehicle is perfect for the urban environment with its busy roads, hence why our three low trucks are based in Greater London. However, in more rural conditions the driving position and height above the road of a standard HGV often enables the driver to see the traffic much further ahead and anticipate any problems.<\/p> <p>\u201cThe low entry cab truck offers significant advantages in terms of ensuring vulnerable road users safety and we would like to further increase the numbers of this type of vehicle CEMEX UK operates, including in our Readymix concrete operations. However, the whole journey of the vehicles needs to be considered from the pick-up point on a CEMEX site to the delivery of the building material at the customer\u2019s location. <\/p> <p>\u201cDue to the design of the low cab truck, it requires the road and access surfaces to be relatively level and in reasonable condition, not always easy on construction sites. We therefore, need the whole supply chain and the industry to be committed to enabling this type of vehicle to become the norm in the construction industry.\u201d<\/p> <p>The company has also invested in a new video on the Econic and its features highlighting to the audience the possible dangers around HGVs (heavy goods vehicles).  The video will be a focal point of the on-going training programme for all CEMEX drivers and in addition, it is hoped that cycling groups and organizations will use it to further educate their members.

Constructed on behalf of Progress Rail, suppliers of rail parts, for Network Rail, the multiple crossing consists of 10 sets of switches through the 1800 metres of rail track.<\/p> <p>The 1800 metre bespoke crossing was designed and constructed at CEMEX\u2019s Rail Solutions Somercotes site in Derbyshire. Each bearer was numbered and colour coded before stacking and transporting to the Beeston assembly facility, then onto Hoo junction, a rail yard near Rochester for layout and addition of the track.<\/p> <p>The multiple crossing is being laid outside Waterloo station, which has 24 platforms and an estimated 99.1million passenger journeys* equivalent to three people per second getting on and off at the terminus. <\/p> <p>\u201cThere were many challenges in producing this size of multiple crossing. The main one was ensuring the data transfer of the 1:50 drawing into the data sets that we would use within our production process to the actual crossing and to ensure that each rail position was within 1mm of its set position. Add to this the complexity of each individual bearer, the sheer volume of individual units and concrete it was quite a challenge,\u201d comments Terence Clair, Operations Manager CEMEX Rail Solutions.<\/p> <p>He continues \u201cIn the past the crossings would have been made of timber with the rail and plates laid on top and screwed in place. This unique crossing, made of concrete has to have the securing fixings created during the production process. Being made of concrete makes it stronger and with a longer life span. <\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great job and highlights how CEMEX Rail can innovate and create bespoke systems for the rail industry.

They only remain in Britain from May to August. At the beginning of the summer they fly from Africa to the UK to nest and raise their chicks. Over the course of their 6,000 mile journey they never touch the ground; eating and sleeping whilst in flight. <\/p> <p>Their diet consists of insects like flies, mosquitoes and midges. Swifts collect insects by making a ball of food (or \u201cbolus\u201d) in their throat, which can contain up to 1,000 insects. They feed the chicks many times a day and the parents can gather as many as 100,000 insects a day.<\/p> <p>Swifts fly on average 800 km every day (nearly 500 miles), and about 2 million km (more than 1.2 million miles) in a lifetime, which is more than four trips to the Moon and back.<\/p> <p>Their nests are minimal, made from stuff they collect in the air, such as feathers, paper, straw, hay and seeds. These materials are cemented with saliva and used to build a nest in open eaves, under loose roof tiles and in holes in walls. After the chicks have fledged most of the nest is disposed of by invertebrates and the remaining is often reused year after year.<\/p><ul><li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website <a href=\"http://www.cemex.co.uk\">www.cemex.co.uk<\/a><\/li><li><b>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 <\/b>CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.  We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.          <\/li><li><b>About CEMEX: <\/b>CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

CEMEX UK is working with the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) to restore lowland heathland on the site.<\/p> <p>CEMEX UK and RSPB have collaborated with the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario (BIO) and SAP (System Applications Products) to collect insects using a Malaise trap and apply DNA barcoding technologies with data analytics to map the species found at the site<\/p> <p>The results have revealed the presence of two nationally rare flies, Eurthyneura albipennis and Platypalpus pulicarius, both species only recorded on three UK sites, plus two nationally scarce species Meromyza mosquensis and Rhaphium micans.<\/p> <p>\u201cBoth this ground breaking technology and the results are of tremendous importance and it has been fascinating to find such rare species present at Rugeley. The DNA anaylsis of insects could offer the next generation of solutions to managing and conserving the biodiversity around the company\u2019s 400 operational sites,\u201d comments Andy Spencer, Director of Sustainability, CEMEX UK.<\/p> <p>The pilot involved capturing insects on site using a Malaise trap \u2013 a mesh tent with an opening for insects to fly in to \u2013 and collecting their DNA sequences to be compared to the BIO\u2019s database of over 5.5 million species barcode sequences to give an accurate species map for the collection site.<\/p> <p>Sam Tarrant, RSPB Business Conservation Manager, said: \u201cThis new innovative project is another brilliant example of how conservation and business can effectively work together to help build a brighter future for nature. Using the insect DNA we are able to establish the natural condition of sites and then work with CEMEX on how best to move forward in turning them into first class homes for nature.\u201d   <\/p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see these former quarry sites returned to nature and to watch the flocks of birds, wild plants and insects slowly take over. To think a few years ago CEMEX was excavating minerals from some of these areas and now they are beautiful nature reserves alive with wildlife for everyone to enjoy.<\/p> <p>Providing first class natural habitat for wildlife by restoring worked-out areas in quarries has been one of the aims of the partnership between CEMEX UK and the RSPB. This groundbreaking scheme will help map out the species found on these restored wildlife sites allowing conservationists to develop the habitat perfect for the UK\u2019s struggling species.<\/p> <p>To learn more about CEMEX UK\u2019s partnership with the RSPB and see how they\u2019re helping to provide more places for nature \u2013 <a href=\"/rspb-partnership.aspx\">/rspb-partnership.aspx<\/a><\/p> <p>-Ends-<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p><b>Notes to editors:<\/b><\/p> <p>For further CEMEX information contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a>Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t: 01932 583214 and RSPB Harry Bellew, Media Officer: 01767 693418 / <a>Harry-jay.Bellew@rspb.org.uk<\/a><\/p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li style=\"color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><p>The insects identified were:<\/p><\/li><\/ul> <p>Euthyneura albipennis a Nationally Rare fly that according to last taxonomic review in 2005 only occurs in three UK sites and is mostly associated with ancient woodland<\/p> <p>Meromyza mosquensis a Nationally Scarce fly<\/p> <p>Platypalpus pulicarius a Nationally Rare fly that according to last taxonomic review in 2005 only has three post-1960 UK sites<\/p> <p>Rhaphium micans a widespread but Nationally Scarce fly<\/p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li style=\"color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><p>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/p><\/li><\/ul> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li style=\"color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><p><b>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 <\/b>CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.  We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.          <\/p><\/li><li style=\"color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><p><b>About CEMEX: <\/b>CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

Extensive investment and stakeholder engagement has returned impressive results on all these initiatives.\u201d<\/p><p>\nThe initiatives have covered all areas of the transport business - driver training, additional safety features on their large goods vehicles (LGVs) and a comprehensive education programme working with cyclists to highlight the dangers about LGVs. A key aspect has also been working with industry bodies to help achieve a national standard of safety features on vehicles and increase the awareness of the issues involved.\n\n<\/p><p>\u201cWe have to share the limited road space and increasingly have an appreciation and respect for everyone\u2019s needs on the roads.  We need to get building materials to construction sites to build homes, roads, hospitals etc and cyclists and pedestrians need to get to work and go about their business.  A large lorry and a cyclist do not make a harmonious mix!\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to have won this award and receive recognition of the work that we have done, \u201ccomments Dave Hart, Director CEMEX Logistics.\n<\/p><p>\nInnovations in safety features such as additional  mirrors, proximity sensors and cameras have been added where appropriate to CEMEX vehicles, and been selected on evidence-based research that show a guaranteed benefit. <\/p><p>\n\nThe latest innovation looks at the vehicle as a whole and has produced a redesign to a standard tipper vehicle. CEMEX is about to add a new Econic aggregate tipper to its London fleet.  Working with Mercedes Benz, the new vehicle provides up to 90% additional visibility while still carrying 20 tonnes of aggregates and has been successfully trialled in the London urban delivery environment. <\/p><p>\n\nWorking with cyclists, CEMEX colleagues have been encouraged   approximately 7000 cyclists since 2010 to get into the cab of one of the vehicles and learn about the potential blind areas around an LGV.  These events are known as Exchanging Places and CEMEX has taken part in over 40 events throughout the country. <\/p><p>\n\nBut with the latest safety features on trucks and working with cyclists, a key aspect of the company\u2019s success is Driver training and engagement.  Every driver receives a minimum of 3 training sessions a year. All 92 drivers in the London Readymix business have taken part in the Safe Urban Driving course and this programme is being rolled out nationally amongst the Logistics drivers, who drive cement tankers and aggregate tippers, as part of their driver CPC programme. <\/p><p>\n\nThe Safe Urban Driving course gives drivers the knowledge, skills and defensive driving techniques to deal with the challenges of driving in a busy urban environment.  It includes drivers getting on bikes to see the road from the cyclist\u2019s perspective.\n<\/p><p>\nEnds\n<\/p>"

These measures in conjunction with events like Exchanging Places with organisations such as the Metropolitan Police, to educate cyclists of the dangers around large goods vehicles have helped reduce our incidents with vulnerable road users.   <\/p><p>\u201cCEMEX and the construction industry have a responsibility to look at the design of the vehicles that are used day-in and day-out and are an integral part of the business. We are a CLOCS Champion, an industry-supported, Transport for London-backed initiative aimed at rolling out a consistent standard for managing work related road safety.   <\/p><p>\u201cThis new design could completely revolutionise the design of the construction vehicle of the future,\u201d he concludes.   <\/p><p>The Econic tipper will be based at CEMEX\u2019s Angerstein Quarry near Dartford and will supply sand and gravel to CEMEX\u2019s London concrete plants and local customers, travelling through the busy roads of the city.   <\/p><p>The tipper is fitted with a Wilcox Wilcolite insulated smooth rigid tipping body and is designed to take a payload of 20 tonnes, the same as a standard tipper.  It is a marked step forward as previous high visibility design vehicles have had capacities of around 16 tonnes.    <\/p><p>Ends<\/p><p><strong><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Notes to editors<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;\">: <\/span><\/p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">For further details on CEMEXUK contact Elizabeth Young; email: <strong><a href=\"mailto:elizabeth.young@cemex.com\">elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"><strong> <\/strong>t: <a href=\"tel:01932%20583214\">01932 583214<\/a>. <\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Follow us on Twitter@CEMEX_UK<\/span><\/li><li><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 <\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future. <span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"> <\/span> <div> <\/div><\/span><\/li><li><strong><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">About CEMEX: <\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

The two companies will now work together to promote the system, integrating other products from the CEMEX range to offer a packaged solution to the housing market.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">The system is currently being used in a development of 18 houses by Gusto Homes in Lincoln. It creates an integrated thermal shell for the house, giving years of energy savings and a more comfortable living environment. The polystyrene and concrete contribute to an environmentally friendly system using sustainable and recyclable materials, resulting in a structure which can offer low, zero or passive energy performance.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">The houses will achieve U-Values in the range of 0.30W/m3k down to 0.10W/m2k, highlighting the effectiveness of ICF. Cavity walls have an approximate value of 1.6 W/m2k and solid brick wall 2.0 W/m2k.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">CEMEX has supplied in excess of 900 cu metres of concrete and screed to the development to date from its local plant in Lincoln. The ICF units were manufactured and supplied by Beco from their facility in Brigg, North Lincolnshire. The project represents the first major venture between the 2 companies.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">\u201cICF is not a new concept and is prominent within the self build market where Beco have vast experience and an excellent reputation. CEMEX Ready Wallform is positioned to take construction of houses and a wider range of buildings such as apartments, office blocks, hotels and care homes into the modern age. <span> <\/span>The concrete provides a high-strength, thermal structure with the added benefit of the polystyrene blocks providing considerable additional thermal insulation, \u201c comments Mathew Tranter, Business Manager \u2013 Housing Solutions<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">\u201cFor the house builder the system is fast and simple to construct with significantly lower labour costs and no ongoing maintenance required. The houses in Lincoln are designed to maximise thermal efficiency and represent an important step towards more medium and large scale developments adopting ICF technology. The establishment of the partnership with CEMEX demonstrates a strong belief in the system and confirmation that alternative methods of construction are shifting firmly into the mainstream.\u201d<span>  <\/span>concludes Robin Miller of Beco Wallform<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">Ends<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\"> Find out more about Ready Wallform Insulated Concrete Forms system <a href=\"/insulating-concrete-formwork-for-housing-and-buildings.aspx\">here<\/a><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\"><\/span><\/p><p><strong><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">Notes to editors<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; color: black;\">: <\/span><\/p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">For further details on CEMEXUK contact Elizabeth Young; email: <\/span><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: windowtext;\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> t: <span class=\"skype_c2c_print_container notranslate\">01932 583214<\/span><span tabindex=\"-1\" class=\"skype_c2c_container notranslate\" id=\"skype_c2c_container\" dir=\"ltr\" onmouseover=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common\" dir=\"ltr\" skypeaction=\"skype_dropdown\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_textarea_span\" id=\"non_free_num_ui\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_text_span\">01932 583214<\/span><span class=\"skype_c2c_free_text_span\"><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span>. <\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Follow us on Twitter@CEMEX_UK<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Key points about CEMEX Ready Wallform:<\/span> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The Wallform components are delivered to site in packs or bags.

Twite is one of only two British birds that feed their young entirely on seed, so an abundant supply close to their nests is vital. <\/span><\/p><p><span>Working in partnership with the RSPB, the five hectare field right next to the Twites\u2019 breeding area has just been planted with a special seed mix to encourage a flower-rich meadow. Next spring it will provide those vital seeds needed by the chicks.<\/span><\/p><p><span>The Twite has the most restricted distribution of any English breeding bird, close to extinction and holding on to survival by the skin of its beak.<span>  <\/span>The majority of the population is centred on the South Pennine moorlands near Huddersfield but there is a tiny population that nests in Dove Holes quarry.<\/span><\/p><p><span>These small birds nest in fissures, long narrow cracks, in the quarry face. They have declined rapidly in the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century as traditional late-cut hay meadows have been replaced by Rye grass silage fields which provided no food for the Twite.<span>  <\/span>Today, it is thought that there are fewer than 100 breeding pairs in England. <\/span><\/p><p><span>George Hudson, a keen local birder has been watching the birds on the site for years comments \u201cDespite the fact that they are tough little birds, we are in a grim position throughout the country.<span>  <\/span>In 2008 there were around 50 Twite in this area, but they have hung on in the quarry and through the summer we have seen around 10 or 11 but no young. They can recover from this very small number and the new meadow will make all the difference, giving them a fighting chance.\u201d <\/span><\/p><p><span>Tim Melling, RSPB Conservation Officer said \u201cTwite used to be common and widespread throughout the Peak District but now this tiny population is all that remains.<span>  <\/span>If we lose these birds we might never get them back, but if we help them, they may provide a nucleus to regain its former status in the Peak.<span>  <\/span>Creating this perfect meadow right next to their nesting grounds should certainly help. \u201d<\/span><span><\/span><span> <\/span> <\/p><p><span>Ends<\/span><\/p><strong>Notes to editors: <\/strong><p> For further information on CEMEX  UK contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com?subject=UK%20Website%20Press%20Release%20Enquiry\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t: <span class=\"skype_c2c_print_container\">01932 583214<\/span><span dir=\"ltr\" class=\"skype_c2c_container\" onmouseover=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)\" tabindex=\"-1\" onmouseout=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(event)\" skype_menu_props=\"{'numberToCall':'+441932583214','isFreecall':false,'isMobile':false,'isRtl':false}\"><span dir=\"ltr\" class=\"skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common\" skypeaction=\"skype_dropdown\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_textarea_span\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_text_span\">01932 583214<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span>. <\/p><ul><li>Look out for more news stories on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CEMEX_UK\" target=\"_blank\">@CEMEX_UK<\/a><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Helping to build a Great Britain<\/strong> \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.  We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.   <\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong> CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

During September and October nearly 2000 people including CEMEX employees, contractors and suppliers will have attended one of 18 days training, at locations throughout the country.<\/span><\/p> <p><span>According to David Harding, MPA Wales the day\u2019s training was \u201cvery different and a creative way of getting staff involved in the issues.\u201d The day focused on a real live incident at one of CEMEX plants, with actors playing out the possible actions and decisions that led to a major incident and resulted in an employee being disabled. <\/span><\/p> <p><span>Following each of the four scenarios, CEMEX colleagues are prompted by the facilitator to discuss, evaluate and consider what happened and why.<span>  <\/span>Andy Taylor Health and Safety Director \u201cUsing actors gives a very human element to the narrative of the incident and helps colleagues to understand the situation and enable learning. It\u2019s a graphic illustration of how we can all step-in and prevent incidents.\u201d<\/span><\/p> <p><span>But there was a lot more to the day, with different exercises including a discussion on the DuPont Bradley Curve. Everyone debates if CEMEX colleagues are reactive, dependent, independent or interdependent when it comes to safety.<span>  <\/span>The ideal situation would be interdependent, when everyone has a shared understanding and responsibility resulting in zero incidents. Another exercise includes an analysis of SwissAir Flight 111 and the nature of errors. <\/span><\/p> <p><span>A fun exercise of the day centres around team building and creation of interdependency. Teams of eight colleagues have to lower a rod to the floor, it may sound easy but requires significant communication amongst the team. <\/span><\/p> <p><span>Andy Taylor comments \u201cIt\u2019s a very rewarding day and as Ghandi says \u201cyou have to be the change you want to see\u201d.<span>  <\/span>Let\u2019s hope more CEMEX colleagues feel empowered to step-in.\u201d<\/span><\/p> <p><span>Some thoughts on the day:<\/span><\/p> <p><span>Stuart Keighley, Readymix Director Central: the training got everyone in the room involved in the issue of stepping in.<span>  <\/span>We have to stop, think, step-in and make a difference.<\/span><\/p> <p><span>Richard Hughes, Contractor, Lowther Forestry Group: Powerful, fast and furious.<span>  <\/span>You learnt things without knowing you were learning and understanding.<\/span><\/p> <p><span>Rebecca Rickaby,<span>  <\/span>Commercial Assistant, CEMEX Marine: Deeply impressed,<span>  <\/span>it was brilliant.<span>  <\/span>Interesting to see how people really communicate in a situation<\/span><\/p> <p><span>Duncan Hargreaves,<span>  <\/span>H & S manager: very relevant to everyone in our industry<\/span><\/p> <p><span>Rob Cunningham, Supply Chain Manager, Aggregates South: highlights the peer pressures that can lead to a disaster.

      "Body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;\"><\/span><\/p><p>CEMEX UK and RSPB (Royal Society for the protection of birds) are working together on an urgent and important mission to help reverse the fortunes of turtle doves. Together they have begun a three year conservation project at four carefully chosen CEMEX quarries in central England.<\/p> <p>Turtle doves are declining at an alarming rate; their UK population is currently halving in number every six years. We have lost a staggering 95% of our turtle dove population since 1970. This UK decline is being paralleled by a 77% decline across Europe since 1980. <\/p> <p>Turtle doves are the UK\u2019s only migratory dove. They breed in England and will be undertaking on their 3000 mile journey to spend the winter in sub-Saharan West Africa over the next few weeks. The main contributor for the decline is thought to be the loss of suitable habitat and associated food shortages in their breeding grounds. <\/p> <p>Unlike other UK dove species, turtle doves rely upon seeds for food. Changes in farming practices have led to field margins and hedges, once rich with seed-bearing plants, being replaced by commercial crops, offering very few of the small seeds that they need. This is a problem because turtle doves require seeds to feed their nestlings. CEMEX quarries have the potential to support this threatened bird.<\/p> <p>The quarries, Norton Subcourse (Norfolk); Hatfield (Hertfordshire); Southam (Warwickshire) and Tattershall (Lincolnshire), offer a suitable habitat with dense scrub and water.  The project involves growing a special flower mix to provide the bird\u2019s ideal food complemented by the nesting habitat. <\/p> <p>The seed mix being sown on CEMEX quarries will provide flowering plants that produce seed by early May, around the time that the doves arrive from their winter homes and are in need of plentiful food to bring them into breeding condition.<\/p> <p>Volunteers will record turtle dove numbers in early summer at the four quarries sown with the enhanced seed mix. Five other sites without the seed mix will also be monitored for comparison.<\/p> <p>The CEMEX and RSPB project forms part of the partnership Operation Turtle Dove and will link with similar projects that BirdLife International is co-ordinating along the migration path across<\/p> <p>France and Spain. Operation Turtle Dove is a partnership between the RSPB, Conservation Grade, Pensthorpe Conservation Trust, and Natural England. <\/p> <p>Rob Doody, CEMEX\u2019s Director for Aggregate Operations, CEMEX UK said \u201cThis project is so important in saving this iconic bird.  It highlights the positive impact that we can make on the natural world. The balance between the natural and built environment is a delicate one which must be preserved not only for nature but future generations.<\/p> <p>\u201cAfter all what would the \u2018Twelve Days of Christmas\u2019 be without 2 Turtle Doves!\u201d<\/p> <p>Ends<\/p> <p><strong>Notes to editors<\/strong>: <\/p> <ul><li>For further information on CEMEXUK contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t: <span class=\"skype_c2c_print_container notranslate\">01932 583214<\/span><span id=\"skype_c2c_container\" class=\"skype_c2c_container notranslate\" dir=\"ltr\" tabindex=\"-1\" onmouseover=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)\" onmouseout=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(this, event)\" onclick=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.makeCall(this, event)\" data-numbertocall=\"+441932583214\" data-isfreecall=\"false\" data-isrtl=\"false\" data-ismobile=\"false\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common\" dir=\"ltr\" skypeaction=\"skype_dropdown\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_textarea_span\" id=\"non_free_num_ui\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_text_span\">01932 583214<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span class=\"skype_c2c_print_container notranslate\">01932 583214<\/span><span id=\"skype_c2c_container\" class=\"skype_c2c_container notranslate\" dir=\"ltr\" tabindex=\"-1\" onmouseover=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)\" onmouseout=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(this, event)\" onclick=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.makeCall(this, event)\" data-numbertocall=\"+441932583214\" data-isfreecall=\"false\" data-isrtl=\"false\" data-ismobile=\"false\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common\" dir=\"ltr\" skypeaction=\"skype_dropdown\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_textarea_span\" id=\"non_free_num_ui\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_text_span\">01932 583214<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span> Follow us on Twitter @cemex_uk <\/li><li>Operation Turtle Dove is a partnership conservation project between the RSPB, Conservation Grade, Natural England and Pensthorpe Conservation Trust and was launched in Spring 2012.

The award was presented by actor and comedian, Rob Brydon.  <br><br>Since 2004 CEMEX UK has developed a significant cyclist safety programme including training programmes for its drivers, innovations and measures for its 900+ large goods vehicles (LGV's) to help them detect cyclists close to the vehicles, sharing best practice with contract hauliers and events to help educate cyclists about the dangers around lgvs.  <br><br>The work has helped influence and shape guidelines for its trade associations, the Mineral Products Association and the Freight Transport Association and company representatives have been involved with Transport for London to establish industry standards and lobby the European Parliament.<br><br>The awards, organised by Motor Transport magazine, are the road transport industry event of the year, recognising innovation, outstanding service, efficiency and quality. Winning a Motor Transport award shows that a business has reached the very highest standards, as judged by an independent panel of experts drawn from the industry.<br><br>The judges said CEMEX is leading the industry in cycle safety and takes an exhaustive approach to the issue of reducing road risks, focusing on sharing road space.<br><br>The judges added: \u201cIt has dealt with a difficult issue, making proactive moves on cycle safety. CEMEX has been on a journey to make its vehicles ever safer for vulnerable road users for more than a decade, after the death of Alex McVitty in 2000 who was hit by one of its concrete mixers.\u201d<br><br>Craig Williamson, Director of Logistics comments \u201cWe were delighted to receive this major award.  It was recognition of all the hard work and commitment that everyone, from every part of the CEMEX business, has made to making the roads safer for vulnerable road users so that we can all share our roads safely.\u201d<br><p>Ends <\/p><strong>Notes to editors: <\/strong><p> For further information on CEMEX  UK contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com?subject=UK%20Website%20Press%20Release%20Enquiry\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t:<span class=\"skype_c2c_print_container notranslate\">01932 583214<\/span><span id=\"skype_c2c_container\" class=\"skype_c2c_container notranslate\" dir=\"ltr\" tabindex=\"-1\" onmouseover=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)\" onmouseout=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(this, event)\" onclick=\"SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.makeCall(this, event)\" data-numbertocall=\"+441932583214\" data-isfreecall=\"false\" data-isrtl=\"false\" data-ismobile=\"false\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common\" dir=\"ltr\" skypeaction=\"skype_dropdown\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_textarea_span\" id=\"non_free_num_ui\"><span class=\"skype_c2c_text_span\">01932 583214<\/span><span class=\"skype_c2c_free_text_span\"><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p><ul><li>Look out for more news stories on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CEMEX_UK\" target=\"_blank\">@CEMEX_UK<\/a><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Helping to build a Great Britain<\/strong> \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.  We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.   <\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong> CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

The burial represents an unusual and important find as the remains were those of a woman and within the grave were some gold ornaments.\n<\/p><p>This follows the find at Kingsmead of four Neolithic houses which date back over 5,700 years, unprecedented on a single site in England.\n<\/p><p>Dr Stuart Needham, a leading expert on Copper Age metalwork, who is presently studying the gold ornaments said: \u201cBeaker graves of this date are almost unknown in South East England and only a small number of them, and indeed in continental Europe, contain gold ornaments. The tubular beads that were found at Kingsmead Quarry are certainly rare in Britain.\n<\/p><p>The burial contained the remains of a woman who was at least 35 years old. At the time of her burial, she wore a necklace containing small tubular sheet gold beads and black disc beads of lignite - a material similar to jet.\n<\/p><p>A number of larger perforated red amber buttons/fasteners were also found in the grave, positioned in a row along the body. They may indicate that the woman was wearing clothing, perhaps of patterned woven wool, at the time of her burial. Further lignite beads from near her hands suggest that she may have been wearing a bracelet. <\/p><p>\nMost early Beaker burials are found to contain male skeletons. It would appear that according to their religious beliefs, they were buried in a crouched position with the head resting to the north and facing east. However, with women the body position is often reversed with the head to the south, as at Kingsmead.\n<\/p><p>This woman of importance was found with a large drinking vessel, unusually placed on her hip rather than by her feet or shoulder. The fine pottery vessel had been decorated with a comb-like stamp.\n<\/p><p>Gareth Chaffey, Site Director, Wessex Archaeology who has been excavating the site for the last seven years, said: \u201cIt is interesting to think who this woman was within her community. She was probably an important person in her society, perhaps holding some standing which gave her access to prestigious, rare and exotic items. She could have been a leader, a person with power and authority, or possibly part of an elite family - perhaps a princess or queen.

These discoveries by excavators from Wessex Archaeology are key to enhancing the knowledge and understanding of this period nationally and at a local level tell us more about the history of the area around the Rivers Colne and Thames near Windsor. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately only the ground plans have survived as any timber would have rotted away long ago. \u201c<\/p>\n<p>However, we have a good idea of what these structures may have looked like from the many house finds in Ireland, from experimental work reconstructing prehistoric buildings, and for wood working techniques from timber-built walkways of the same date, such as the Sweet Track, that were found preserved in the peat deposits of the Somerset Levels. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese finds add to our knowledge of life in Neolithic times and how buildings at that date were constructed,\u201d comments Dr Alistair Barclay, Wessex Archaeology.  <\/p>\n<p>The houses were probably built by pioneer farmers that had moved into the area bringing with them the knowledge and woodworking skills necessary to construct substantial buildings. The area was ideal for a settlement, it was close to the River Colne and there would have been ample woodland nearby. <\/p>\n<p>All the houses were rectangular in shape with the largest being 15 x 7 metres. Two were constructed out of upright oak planks set into foundation trenches, whilst the others were built using wooden posts. <\/p>\n<p>Pottery, flint tools, arrowheads, rubbing stones for grinding corn and charred food remains were recovered from the buildings confirming the lifestyle of the inhabitants and the approximate age of the houses. <\/p>\n<p>Radiocarbon dating has been used to confirm the age of one of the houses (3800\u20133640 BC) and further dates will be obtained for the other buildings later in 2013, on the charred remains of cereal and hazelnut shell. <\/p>\n<p>The excavations are part of CEMEX\u2019s £4 million archaeological programme on the site, which has been in operation since 2003. <\/p>\n<p>Andy Spencer, Sustainability Director, CEMEX commented \u201c In addition to extracting valuable building materials that go into buildings all around us, quarrying has given us some wonderful archaeological finds that tell us more about our ancestors and how they lived. At Kingsmead, the scope of the finds covers thousands of years and has provoked some interesting debate about the people who lived there.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Ends <\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Note to editors:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kingsmead Quarry, <\/strong>sand and gravel has been quarried in the area since 1946 and it is estimated will provide 2.5 million tonnes of sand and gravel over the next 10 years. <\/li><li><strong>Helping to build a Greater Britain<\/strong> \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.  We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.      <\/li><li><strong>Wessex Archaeology<\/strong> is one of the largest heritage practices in the UK.

With this grounding it is hoped to create a mobile talent-pool feeding into senior management positions of the future. <\/p>\n<p>The three employees have come from across the CEMEX business. Tom Colley is a former batcher at CEMEX Middlesborough concrete plant. Previously he worked as a transport planner for a haulier company. <\/p>\n<p>Richard Allen was a sales agent at the CEMEX Customer Service centre in Rugby and has completed a City and Guilds in concrete technology. He also taught sport at a local grammar school. <\/p>\n<p>Scott Jones, based in Liverpool, was a Business Performance Analyst in CEMEX Readymix and has a BA Hons degree in Business and Economics. <\/p>\n<p>Each trainee will be assigned a mentor and programme coordinator to help implement an individual development plan. Over 2013 they will spend time within each of the business areas including operations, strategic planning, human resources and procurement.<\/p>\n<p> \u201cThis scheme is fundamental to our future business. We provide vital building materials to the construction industry; it is a complex business in which the products cement, concrete and aggregates are used in significant quantities every single day. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cConcrete, for instance, is the most used man-made material in the world and has technological advances on a regular basis.

Management of the land around the sites through landscape-scale conservation now provides better butterfly habitat. An outstanding example of landscape-scale conservation is the \u2018butterfly amphitheatre\u2019 created at Rugby cement plant. Here, as with the other sites such as New Bilton Quarry, the aim is to connect more areas of suitable habitat, preventing species from becoming marooned in one area with limited food sources and possibility of inbreeding.<\/p>\n\n<p>Warwickshire Butterfly Conservation Officer, Mike Slatter comments \u201c 2012 was disastrously wet for butterflies and it dented the good conservation progress made in recent years. However, with the provision of better quality habitat, and in this case some of the best habitat, on a landscape scale such as on these CEMEX sites, recovery can take place.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The conservation work is continuing with activities such as the seeding of Birds-food trefoil, Kidney Vetch and Creeping Cinquefoil much to the delight of the butterfly population in Warwickshire.<\/p>\n\n<p>RSPB and CEMEX UK are working together to enrich nature and increase the biodiversity of CEMEX UK operations. In 2010, CEMEX supported by the RSPB, launched its biodiversity strategy with a commitment to the creation and maintenance of 1,000 hectares of priority habitats by 2020.

The book initiative was launched on the back of the United Nations Rio Earth Summit in 1992 as part of a strategy to help conserve the world\u2019s natural resources.\n<p>As a leading construction solutions provider CEMEX recognises the need to balance the production of building materials with the protection and maintenance of a sustainable environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>A Gift Of Nature has been published in partnership with Earth in Focus, Conservation International, International Union for Conservation of Nature, BirdLife International, Wildlife Conservation Society, The Wild Foundation, Nature Serve and Wetlands International. It provides an updated look at the past two decades, and calls for renewed attention to conservation using science and photography.<\/p>\n\n<p>The conservation book initiative is integral to CEMEX\u2019s sustainability strategy. According to CEMEX UK President, Jesus Gonzalez, \u201cit is a platform for sponsoring and giving leading not-for-profit conservation bodies a voice and for us to put the spotlight on key conservation issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is also integral to a CEMEX UK strategy, which involves helping to build a Greater Britain through sustainable growth. Today\u2019s challenge is to achieve this goal against the backdrop of a shortage in housing, the need to improve infrastructure, secure energy supply and manage water and waste more responsibly and effectively,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cBy offering services and solutions which maximise the sustainable attributes of construction projects, we can help make the low carbon economy a reality,\u201d he concluded. A Gift of Nature was launched at a reception in the Mexican Ambassador\u2019s Residence in London to representatives from politics, business and the conservation sectors. Amongst them were The Rt Hon Michael Fallon, MP and Minister of State for Business and Energy. Michael Fallon said:<\/p>\n\n<p>\"As demonstrated by CEMEX and their conservation partners, business interests and environmental interests don\u2019t have to conflict. Rather, they can enrich and complement each other.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Working in partnership with industry, the Government\u2019s new Industrial Strategy for Construction will set out our long term approach to supporting business, to give the industry further confidence for investment and growth.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>More information:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Pictures from the launch are avialable from <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48719552@N06\" target=\"blank\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/48719552@N06/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>For further information contact Elizabeth Young, email: <a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> telephone: 01932 583214<\/p>\n\n<p>A Gift of is available as ebook via this link: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cemex-nature/id571339550?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cemex-nature/id571339550?mt=8<\/a><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Helping to build a Greater Britain<\/strong> \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.&nbsp; We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>CEMEX <\/strong>is a global building solutions company and leading supplier of cement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates.

The webcam was set up at the quarry and the camera attached to the rock face before the peregrines began nesting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Their nesting and fledging activities are recorded day and night to enable valuable research to be undertaken. The falcons, said to be the fastest species of bird in the world reaching speeds exceeding 180 kilometres an hour, find quarries to be the ideal habitat for nesting.<\/p>\n\n<p>They generally select isolated protected areas near good hunting grounds with the nest simply scraped out of a shallow depression. A pair of falcons will usually return to the same nest year after year.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the tenth successive year that the birds have returned to Wick. Also nesting at the site are ravens and kestrels. John Morris, Wildspace! Partnership Project Officer for South Gloucestershire Council said: <em>\"We are all enjoying watching these magnificent birds through the website, www.peregrinewatch.info. This valuable project will allow us to build up a picture of how these amazing birds live\".<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX assistant quarry manager and keen bird watcher, Ben Staff, said: <em>\"The quarry is home to a wide range of wildlife including these birds, illustrating just some of the benefits that aggregate extraction can bring to the local environment.

West country-based wildlife surveillance company Eco-Watch also assists with the monitoring of the birds.<\/p>\n\n<p>The young chick will be able to fly after about 35-40 days after hatching but will remain dependent on the adults for several weeks after they leave the nest.

This allows users to specify a mortar for a particular use, rather than relying on the properties achieved from a general mix design based on non-specific cements and sands.<\/p>\n\n<p>Designed mixes are classified by minimum compressive strength rather than by mix proportion. For Rugby Premium Mortar, a minimum strength of 4 N/mm2 is guaranteed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Manufactured under a third-party-accredited system, Rugby Premium Mortar is CE-marked to give added assurance of its quality. This mortar is ideal for builders or DIY-ers who wish to use a professional product but who have limited space or site restrictions, and cannot use traditional factory products such as Readyspread or Readymix Dry Silo mortars. It is also ideal for starting or finishing dry silo jobs where smaller quantities of the material are required.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rugby Premium Mortar is composed of precisely weighed cement and sand with accurately dispensed admixtures. Its unique properties give it increased workability and board life, while the controlled air content means it is more resistant to frost attack.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is available in 25kg plastic bags from Rugby stockists throughout the UK. One bag will yield approximately 0.017 cubic metres and 1 cubic metre (64 bags) will lay approximately 1,900 solid bricks, 1,700 frogged bricks or 1,200 blocks each 450 x 225 x100mm.<\/p>\n\n<p>For further information contact:<\/p>\n\n<p>Elizabeth Young<br />\nliz.young@cemex.co.uk<br />\nTelephone: 01932 583214<\/p>"

The client, Slate Developments required the supply of 42cu m of a concrete that would provide a robust solution for a busy delivery yard while producing enough early strength to allow traffic on it within 24 hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">The material used at the depot was the polypropylene fibre reinforced MicroTech PF, one of the four different mixes in the range.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">The others are MicroTech SF, which incorporates steel fibres to deliver exceptional performance, MicroTech HS designed to give 28 day compressive strengths in excess of 80N/mm sq and the all-purpose MicroTech S, suitable for most applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">According to CEMEX UK National Technical Director, Steve Crompton, it is the combination of microsilica and specialist high performance admixtures which makes the concrete very robust. \u201cThe microsilica is actually a very fine dust, about as fine as tobacco smoke. When mixed with the concrete it helps to optimize the void structure of the concrete making it very dense.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">\u201cBecause it is so dense the permeability of the concrete is much lower than standard concrete helping to prevent the ingress of harmful chemicals such as sulfates and chlorides,\u201d he comments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">MicroTech is widely available and can be supplied from all of CEMEX UK concrete plants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Ends <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">NOTES TO EDITORS:<\/span><\/b> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"COLOR: black\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">For further information and photographs contact Elizabeth Young e.

With the construction market under ever increasing pressure these savings go a small way to balance the rising cost of other materials used in the production of vital building materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">The new proactive and structured approach looked at ways of targeting and reducing waste, testing and finding the optimum tyre solutions for different vehicles, with better tyre husbandry, extended tyre life  and improving fuel efficiency.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">The fleet tyre policy uses a tailored range of Continental heavy goods tyres, which are carefully managed and reworked to give maximum life span, optimum performance and fuel economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Environmental benefits have resulted through extending the life of the tyre by reworking and effectively giving it four lives. Every retreaded tyre can save up to 68 litres of oil, 44g of rubber and equivalent of 182kg CO2 compared to a new tyre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">The original new tyre is designed to be re-cut once the tread has worn down to approximately 4mm tread depth.  When this has worn down to its limit it can be returned to Continental and retreaded as a ContiRe tyre, for a third life.  Finally, the retreaded tyre can also be re-cut to extend it into its 4<sup>th<\/sup> life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Craig Williamson, Director of Supply Chain and Logistics \u201cThese applications are not new to the market, but ensuring a holistic management approach to the tyres, on the scale we are dealing with in CEMEX, can have significant economic and environmental benefits.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">\u201cFor our customers, the economic savings on tyres can help us to reduce the impact of escalating prices in other areas of the production of cement, concrete and aggregate and ensure we continue to help build a greater Britain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">\u201cOur strategy is still developing in 2012.

      "Body": "<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">The future of the last remaining quarry train which is on display at the CEMEX Barrington Cement works has been secured following the company\u2019s decision to donate the locomotive and two remaining wagons to Rocks by Rail, a local museum specializing in the preservation of the local area\u2019s industrial heritage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">In 2005 the loco and two wagons were part of the last working standard gauge quarry railway in the UK. At this time, it was decided to replace the rail transportation within the site by the latest methods of mineral excavation and movement.  This signaled the end of nearly 200 years of industrial history which can be traced back to the beginning of the railway age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Aware of the significant historic importance, the loco and two wagons have been preserved on permanent display within the CEMEX site since that time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">With the recent decision to permanently close the site CEMEX has decided to donate and entrust this valuable quarry rolling stock to Rocks by Rail, formerly Rutland Railway Museum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">A registered charity, Rocks by Rail specializes in the preservation, conservation and demonstration of equipment formerly used on standard gauge quarry railways.  The train and two wagons will be moved to the museum\u2019s site at Cottesmore, Rutland where they will join the unique collection of quarry rolling stock. They will be demonstrated to the public at the museum\u2019s own rail connected, mock quarry face.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Ian Southcott, CEMEX UK Community Affairs Manager said : \u2018We are delighted that these important aspects of the industrial heritage of the Barrington Cement Works will not only be preserved but will actually be seen in action at the Rocks by Rail museum.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">In addition, to the donation of the rolling stock, the Rugby Group Benevolent Fund, a charity with close links to the company has provided a grant of £5,000 to cover the cost of transporting the loco and wagons to their new home and creating supporting information for display at the museum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Simon Layfield from Rocks by Rail commented \u201cThrough this generous act CEMEX have safeguarded the future of historic quarry railway items which they were instrumental in saving. We are very grateful for their support both now and in the past. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">\u201cOnce the items arrive at the museum they will supplement the other rolling stock that we have already received from the Barrington Quarry Railway. The arrival of the wagons will enable us to form a genuine quarry train consisting of a loco and four wagons which can be operate in our mock quarry very much in the same way as they used to work at Barrington. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">\u201cWe hope to move the items to the museum in time for their initial display on Sunday 21<sup>st<\/sup> October 2012 when the museum has its next public open day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Ends<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"TEXT-DECORATION: underline\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">Notes to Editors:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">For further information contact Ian Southcott,  <\/span><span><a href=\"mailto:ian.southcott@cemex.com\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">ian.southcott@cemex.com<\/span><\/a><\/span><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\"> t. 01788 517323  m. 07702 918494 or  <\/span><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt\">Simon Layfield, Rocks by Rail (RbR)   tel 07798 - 641105<\/span> <\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">CEMEX <\/span><\/b><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica, sans-serif\">is a global building solutions company and leading supplier of cement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates.

It outlines performance and targets for a number of key\nsustainability principles including those relating to climate change\nlegislation.<\/p>\n<p>A key element in shaping both the format and content of the report\nwas the involvement of an independent organization, The Vivian\nPartnership, to analyse what our stakeholders, local communities,\ncustomers, suppliers, employees, regulators and non-governmental\norganisations felt was important to them to know about CEMEX UK.<\/p>\n<p>Ben Vivian, Vivian Partnership Limited \"We undertook an online and\nface-to-face engagement exercise in the Spring of 2011 with stakeholders\n from all parts of society. The findings have been used by CEMEX UK to\nadjust sustainable development reporting and communication methods.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is increasingly important for companies to move from a 'transmit'\n to a more engaged mode of communication which listens and reacts to\nwhat it hears. In this way a much higher level of authenticity and\nresonance is achieved in reporting.\"<\/p>\n<p>A major achievement was the increased use of alternative waste\nderived fuels, up by 7%, for heating the cement kilns, resulting in a\nsaving of nearly 194,000 tonnes of CO2 emitted. This saving equated to\nreplacement of 52% traditional fossil fuels by alternative fuels such as\n Climafuel, which is made from household waste. This compares well with\nthe average for the cement sector of 38%.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the increased use of fuels derived from waste, process\n wastes, that are produced as part of the operation and destined for\ndisposal were dramatically reduced due to a number of business\ninitiatives. These include recycling opportunities which have been\nprogressed for kiln dusts in our cement business, introduction of waste\nminimization measures and vehicle wash waste management in our readymix\nbusiness.<\/p>\n<p>The substantial reduction in LTI's (lost time injuries) from 19 to 6\nincidents (63%) was influenced by the ongoing programme of health and\nsafety management training, which includes a series of Leadership\nWorkshops that build on Visible Felt Leadership (VFL) techniques. The\nprogramme encourages senior management, supervisors and managers to look\n at all aspects of health and safety on the sites and colleagues for\nwhom they are responsible. In 2010 managers and supervisors across the\noperations made 4953 VFL site visits.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, there was improved engagement by the workforce in health\n and safety issues with each employee receiving 24hours worth of safety\ntraining.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the major events during the year was the announcement by CEMEX\n UK and RSPB of the launch of the Biodiversity Strategy, with a\ncommitment to challenging targets including the creation and maintenance\n of 1,000 hectares of priority habitats by 2020.

It works by extracting dust from\n gases produced in the cement kiln and has been installed on the plant's\n exhaust duct to provide a physical barrier to the dust as it passes\nfrom the kiln to the chimney.<\/p>\n<p>Static electricity is generated in the precipitator and gives the\ndust particles a negative charge. The dust particles pass through\npositively charged conducting plates to which they are attracted to form\n a layer. The positive plates are then gently rapped so that the\ncollected dust falls to the bottom of the main hoppers from where it is\ntransported to the dust handling plant for reuse.<\/p>\n<p>The enhanced reduction in dust at the plant and increase in the use\nof alternative fuels to traditional fossil fuels burnt in the kiln\ncombine to help make cement production more sustainable.

South Ferriby plant now also\nleads the way in Europe and within CEMEX\u2019s global network of more than\n60 cement plants worldwide. <\/p>\n\n<p>Further good news is that emissions, such as oxides of nitrogen and\nsulphur, have declined by 20% and 43% respectively since alternative\nfuels were introduced in 2002.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plant Director, Philip Baynes-Clarke, explained: \u201cI am immensely\nproud that this record has been set using a kiln that was commissioned\nin 1973. It proves that with the right team, skills and capital\ninvestment, plants like ours in South Ferriby can have a long and\nhealthy shelf life, and advance our manufacturing heritage. The use of\nalternative fuels at South Ferriby is key to improving the environmental\n performance of cement making. It helps to reduce our carbon footprint,\nbut it also drives down other key emissions. \u201cOur 100% record was set\nover a three day period in March, with the kiln remaining stable and\nproducing good quality cement clinker. The challenge is now to exceed\nour 90% weekly average record and use 100% over a more sustained\nperiod.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Cement-making is energy intensive and involves heating up kilns to at\n least 1400 degrees Celsius. Increasing the use of alternative fuels\nmade from waste is therefore key to saving fossil fuels for future\ngenerations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The alternative fuels used at South Ferriby are Secondary Liquid\nFuels (SLF); made from industrial liquid wastes that cannot be recycled,\n such as paint, thinners, inks and varnishes, and Climafuel®; which is\nmade from household residual and commercial waste that would otherwise\ngo to landfill.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Climafuel used at South Ferriby is sourced from local suppliers.\nLast year, more than 36,000 tonnes of waste that would otherwise be\nlandfilled have been used to make cement in South Ferriby. Based on the\nbiomass content in alternative fuels, the plant has so far this year\nalso saved the equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions that 11,000\ncars produce in a year.<\/p>\n\n<p>ENDS<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>More information and additional photographs<\/strong><br>\nFor photographs and further information contact Marit Meyer-Bell, tel: 0786 765 3392 Email: <a href=\"mailto:marit.meyerbell@hotmail.com\">marit.meyerbell@hotmail.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CEMEX<\/strong><br>\nCEMEX is a global building solutions company and leading supplier of\ncement, readymixed concrete and aggregates.

Prior to extraction the land, which lies within the flood plain of\n the River Breamish, was used for agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>The site has been restored to enhance and complement the surrounding\nrural area and extraction provided an opportunity of transforming an\nintensively farmed landscape into a wildlife haven and local community\namenity.<\/p>\n<p>Dr Darren Moorcroft, Head of Conservation Delivery at the RSPB said\n\"We congratulate CEMEX UK on the new conservation area at Branton. This\nprovides much needed space for nature, and is an excellent example of\nwhat can be achieved by the quarry industry for wildlife and for local\ncommunities to enjoy. The RSPB are pleased to have helped with the\nrestoration through our partnership with CEMEX UK, but equally are\ndelighted with the involvement of local people, and with the\nopportunities it provides for involving school children in learning\nabout their environment.\"<\/p>\n<p>The main area of the site has been developed into two lakes, one with\n a nesting island.  Around the lakes, a limited number of footpaths have\n been created to give access to walkers but with some areas left\nsecluded for wildlife to live, thrive and breed.  Different wildlife\nhabitats have been provided such as owl nesting boxes, wet woodland and\nreedbeds to encourage a diversity of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>A bird hide has been erected by the western lake, donated by\nNorthumberland National Park Authority, and frequently used by the North\n Northumberland Bird Group and local enthusiasts monitor the type and\nnumber of breeds of bird that live and visit the site.  To date 55\nspecies of birds such as Kingfishers, Grey Heron, Barn Owl and more\nendangered species such as Lapwings and Spotted Flycatcher have been\nseen.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the bird species, 14 of mammals; 5 of reptiles and\namphibians, 21 of butterflies and moths and 7 of dragonflies and\ndamselflies have also been reported on the reserve. In the recent warm\nweather, an adder was spotted in the undergrowth and otters are believed\n to be in the area.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>An integral part of the restoration was the development of a 'mini'\nnature reserve with dipping pond specially created for the adjoining\nBranton Community First School. Pupils access their reserve by a\nspecially built bridge, and walkways are cut around the pond area so\nchildren can view the insects and birdlife.<\/p>\n<p>Sand and gravel extraction has taken place in the Breamish Valley\nsince the 1920s when gravel was taken from the river bed for road\nsurfacing. Extraction started at this quarry site in 1996 and over 1.66\nmillion tonnes of sand and gravel has been produced for local\nconstruction projects.

      "Body": "<p><strong><\/strong>During the Team Green\nBritain Bike Week  18 - 26th June, CEMEX UK, the building materials\nsupplier, will be supporting 5 local cycling events to help educate\ncyclists about safe cycling around large vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>At  bike events in Gateshead, Portsmouth, Newcastle, Brighton and\nLondon, CEMEX will be providing one of its fleet of LGVs (large goods\nvehicle) - a concrete mixer , cement tanker or aggregates tipper - to\ndemonstrate the 'blind' areas around large vehicles and encourage\ncyclists to get into the cab to see the road from a driver's\nperspective.<\/p>\n<p>It is estimated that 39% of cycling fatalities nationwide involve\nLGVs against a background of an increasing number of cyclists on more\ncongested roads.<\/p>\n<p>A concrete mixer will be a key part of the Portsmouth 'Bike to work'\nDay, Nicola Waight, road safety co-ordinator said \"Too many accidents\nare caused just by cyclists not being visible to drivers.  We hope by\ncyclists getting the driver's perspective in the CEMEX vehicle they will\n appreciate how difficult it potentially, is to be seen and can make\nsure they place themselves in a safer position.\"<\/p>\n<p>In London CEMEX is supporting an Exchanging Places event organised by\n the City of London and Metropolitan police forces. Organiser, PC Alex\nSweet from the City of London Police said: \"This is a fantastic\nopportunity to learn more about cycle safety with a CEMEX vehicle.   Our\n priority is to reduce the number of cyclists killed and injured on the\nroads.\"<\/p>\n<p>Since 2003, CEMEX has been actively involved in addressing the safety\n of cyclists and other vulnerable road users and today is seen as a\nleader in its sector, for addressing cyclist safety.<\/p>\n<p>Additional safety features have been added to over 450 vehicles in\nthe CEMEX fleet and up to 2,500 independent haulier contractors vehicles\n employed by CEMEX each month.<\/p>\n<p>To help improve visibility in the 'blind spot' around the front and\nnearside corner, a 'fish eye' mirror has been fitted. They have become a\n legal requirement on all new vehicles registered since 2007.  CEMEX has\n ensured that these features have been retrofitted to all vehicles over 3\n years old.<\/p>\n<p>Another important addition is signage.  There are two, one on the\nnearside back corner to discourage cyclists from proceeding up the left\nhand side of the vehicle and, to complement it, a large yellow 'Caution'\n sign running along the side.<\/p>\n<p>Other innovations which are added when appropriate include proximity\nsensors and side under-run bars on tipper trucks have been added as\nextra protection to prevent cyclists falling under the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>\"Both drivers and cyclists have a responsibility for their own, and\neach other's safety. CEMEX has invested in additional safety features\nfor its vehicles and continuous training for its team of drivers,\nhowever we also feel we have an obligation to help promote safe cycling\nto cyclists, \" comments Andy Taylor, UK Director Health and Safety.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>ENDS<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul><li>For further information and photographs contact Elizabeth Young t.  01932 583214  <a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a><\/li><li>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides\nhigh-quality products and reliable service to customers and communities\nin more than 50 countries throughout the world<\/li><li>In the UK, as well as ready mixed concrete, cement and aggregates,\nCEMEX also produces asphalt, and has a significant share of the roof\ntile, rail sleepers, concrete-block paving, and concrete-block segments.\n CEMEX has a national supply network in the UK to ensure that quality\nbuilding materials are available to customers locally.

The awards look not only at accident records but the\n entrants health and safety management systems.<\/p>\n<p>David Rawlins, RoSPA's Award Manager said \"RoSPA firmly believes that\n organisations that have demonstrated their commitment to continuous\nimprovement in accident and ill health prevention deserve recognition.\nCEMEX UK Operations has shown that it is committed to striving for such\ncontinuous improvement and we are delighted to honour it with the\npresentation of these awards.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting further Chris Leese said \"Clearly everyone in CEMEX\nReadymix has much to celebrate in terms of progress in Health and\nSafety.  That said, it is a fact that incidents happen in the future not\n the past and we are determined to avoid any question of complacency.\nWe must remain aware that serious incidents with the potential to cause\nharm continue to occur and so we should stay alert, deal with hazards,\nlook after our colleagues and be determined in our leadership.  In that\nway we will achieve zero harm.\"<\/p>\n<p>One of the main factors influencing all these achievements is CEMEX's\n Visible Felt Leadership (VFL) programme  which encourages senior\nmanagement, supervisors and managers to look at all aspects of health\nand safety on the sites and colleagues for whom they are responsible.<\/p>\n<p>The programme is focussed on improving safety behaviours through\nobservation and discussion, plus a series of workshops, initiated in\n2009, which focus on line management safety leadership skills.\nUnannounced site visits to observe safety behaviours and discuss safety\nwith the workforce form part of the programme.

      "Body": "<p>Building materials\ncompany, CEMEX UK, has published a draft report for public consultation,\n which shows that more than doubling the levels of Climafuel (from 30%\nup to 65%) at its Rugby plant in Warwickshire has environmental\nbenefits. Climafuel is an alternative fuel derived from residual\nhousehold and commercial waste, which is used to heat the cement kiln in\n Rugby.<\/p><p>\n<\/p><p>The report provides an evaluation of using two increased levels of <a target=\"blank\" href=\"/su/su_af_cl.asp\">Climafuel<\/a>\n \u2013 firstly at up to 65% replacement  in combination with coal at 35%,\nand secondly at up to 53% in conjunction with chipped tyres at 12% and\ncoal again at 35% . It also sets out how, in <a href=\"\">CEMEX\u2019s<\/a>\n view, the evaluation has met and exceeded the stringent \u2018critical\nsuccess factor\u2019 criteria developed by the cement industry regulator, the\n <a target=\"blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency\">Environment Agency<\/a> (EA), in advance of the trials.<\/p>\n<p>Following a two month public consultation, CEMEX hopes to secure the\npermanent permission for the use of Climafuel at the maximum rate (up to\n 65%) as demonstrated in the trials, up from 30% from the plant\u2019s\nprevious permit.<\/p>\n<p>The draft report demonstrates that the increased use of Climafuel has\n produced positive results. It shows that during the evaluation there\nwere no breaches of existing emission limit values, and that the overall\n environmental impact is reduced  when Climafuel is used to replace\ntraditional fossil fuels such as coal.<\/p>\n<p>The increased use of Climafuel is also significantly helping to\nreduce the amount of waste material that would otherwise go to landfill.\n In the past 12 months, CEMEX UK has used more than 130,000 tonnes of\nClimafuel at Rugby plant. Based on the biomass content of the fuel, the\nuse of Climafuel has also saved over 155,000 tonnes of CO2 in that time.\n This is the equivalent to saving the CO2 emissions generated by around\n62,000 cars in a year.<\/p>\n<p>The report is available on the company\u2019s website - www.cemex.co.uk  -\n at Rugby Borough Council and Rugby Library.

The\nsensors are activated when the vehicle\u2019s left indicator is on and a\ncyclist moves up the nearside of the vehicle. A voice activated message\nis triggered to warn the cyclist and an alarm in the cab alerts the\ndriver.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur performance in this field reflects the company\u2019s ability to\nthink ahead and go beyond the \u201ccall of duty\u201d, set by legislation.  For a\n rigid vehicle, the sensors cost just £450 and all the features, that is\n the mirrors, signage and if appropriate, under-run safety bars,\napproximately £800.  Even with a large fleet, the time and money\ninvested is worth every penny if it can save just one accident.\u201d  says\nMatt Wild,  Vice President, Commercial Cement, Building Products and\nLogistics.<\/p>\n<p>As a leader in cyclist safety, CEMEX has been chosen by London\nMetropolitan Police to support their \u201cExchanging Places\u201d programme.\nCyclists, at a central London venue, are invited to get into the cab of\nthe vehicle to see the road from the driver\u2019s perspective and learn\nabout the areas around a vehicle where a driver may not see a cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>In addition showing cyclists the safety features, serves to highlight\n the potential dangers and create awareness.

Today,\nthe Reserve comprises over 145 hectares of flooded gravel pits; the\nequivalent to more than 100 football pitches, and since recordings began\n in 1944, over 250 species have been sighted here, including birds such\nas herons, osprey, kingfisher and bittern.<\/p><p>Director for RSPB Scotland, Anne McCall, said: \"By committing to this\n comprehensive biodiversity strategy, CEMEX will, with its employees,\nneighbours and conservation organisations, create habitats and enrich\nour environment here in Scotland.\"<\/p><p>In 2007 CEMEX signed a Memorandum of Understanding with BirdlLife\nInternational to promote biodiversity at an international level.

The chimney, which is taller than the St Paul's Cathedral in\n London (365 foot) dates back to the late 1970s. It originally took nine\n months to build, but will only take nine seconds to come down.\nApproximately 10 kg of a nitroglycerine-based explosive will be used to\ndemolish the chimney around which will be a 250 metre exclusion zone.<\/p>\n<p>On the day, the button will be pressed by former plant employee Dave\nDark who won a competition to raise funds for the Wisdom Hospice in\nRochester, a local charity, which provides palliative and end of life\ncare for patients with life-limiting illness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Demolition of the plant, which covers 11 hectares - the equivalent of\n more than 15 football pitches -, began last March.

The book, which has been developed in association\nwith Conservation International, The Wild Foundation and International\nLeague of Conservation Photographers, outlines the views of leading\nscientists about nature\u2019s ecological services and demonstrates how they\ncontribute to our health, economic prosperity, and cultural values.<\/p>\n<p>The book makes an important contribution to The International Year of\n Biodiversity with its more than 20 essays from renowned conservation\nscientists illustrated by images from leading photographers, by putting\nthe spotlight on how unsustainable economic growth has put a burden on\nnature\u2019s capacity to deliver clean water, fresh air, medicines and\nclimate regulation, among other benefits. Assigning a financial value to\n them is the key to mend some of the environmental impact of human\nactivities.<\/p>\n<p>The Wealth of Nature was presented to Members of Parliament, civil\nservants, community partners, environmentalists and commercial guests at\n a Parliamentary House of Lords reception, which was hosted by Baroness\nGibson of Market Rasen OBE.<\/p>\n<p>Head of the IUCN Ecosystem Management Programme and co-author of the\nbook, Dr Neville Ash said: \u201cWe now recognise that the climate is\nchanging, posing new challenges and threats to nature. Conserving\nbiodiversity will play a key role in our ability to adapt to these\nchanges.<\/p>\n<p>\"Nature provides services that are essential to sustain all life on\nthe planet. These services must be valued according to the multiple\nbenefits that they provide to people, and those communities who work to\nprotect them should be supported to do so. Placing a financial value on\nthe services that nature provides is critical to guarantee that\necosystems stay healthy and continue to provide the benefits that all\npeople depend on to survive.\"<\/p>\n<p>As one of the world\u2019s largest producers of aggregates, cement and\nreadymixed concrete products, CEMEX is committed to sustainable\ndevelopment. From 1993, the company has, in partnership with not for\nprofit organisations, published a new book every year to put the\nspotlight on a number of different conservation issues. \"The Wealth of\nNature\" is the latest book, and the 17th in this series.<\/p>\n<p>President of CEMEX UK, Gonzalo Galindo, said: \u201cFor more than a decade\n we have been partnering with the leading organisations to publish the\nCEMEX Conservation Book Series to help raise awareness of the necessity\nto preserve our natural world. We strongly believe that protecting\necosystems are a fundamental aspect of sustainable development. It has a\n direct impact on the quality of people\u2019s lives all over the world and\nit is essential for the sustainability of every human activity,\nincluding business.<\/p>\n<p>\"In the UK, CEMEX has also entered into a partnership with the Royal\nSociety for the Protection of Birds to develop our biodiversity\nstrategy, which will be launched later this year.

At yesterday\u2019s event, cyclists were shown the\ndriver\u2019s potential \u2018blind area\u2019, the extra safety features on the\nvehicle and encouraged to go into the CEMEX cab and learn about the area\n of visibility around a large vehicle from the driver\u2019s perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the event, the Metropolitan police ticketed cyclists for\nroad offences in the area and these were waived if the cyclist attended\nthe event.  Yesterday 96 cyclists came to Trafalgar Square to learn more\n about safe cycling.<\/p>\n<p>The most dangerous situation for cyclists is when they cycle along\nthe nearside of large vehicles turning left.  To warn cyclists of this\ndanger a warning sign has been fitted to CEMEX vehicles on the rear\nnearside corner to highlight this before they move up the nearside.  A\nlarge Caution sign has been fitted along the left hand side of the\nvehicle to further highlight this danger.<\/p>\n<p>The Caution sign is complemented by sensors which activate a voice\nmessage for the cyclist as they pass alongside the vehicle. Light and\naudible indicators in the cab are also activated by the sensors and show\n the driver that there is movement on the nearside.<\/p>\n<p>To help eliminate the blind spot at the left hand front corner a\nseries of three mirrors including a \u2018fish-eye\u2019 lens have been fitted.\nThe positioning of the mirrors is done using a special \u2018L\u2019 shaped mat\nwhich is laid around the nearside front corner of the vehicle.

This is a new\nrecord for the plant, and could also be a new record in the UK, where\nthe cement industry average is 19.4%*.<\/p>\n\n <br>\n <p>Further good news is that emissions, such as oxides of nitrogen and\nsulphur, have declined by 20% and 43% respectively since alternative\nfuels were introduced in 2002. <\/p>\n\n<p>Cement-making is energy intensive and involves heating up kilns to at\n least 1400 degrees Celsius. Increasing the use of alternative fuels\nmade from waste is therefore key to saving fossil fuels for future\ngenerations. <\/p>\n \t\n<p>The alternative fuels used at South Ferriby are Secondary Liquid\nFuels (SLF); made from industrial liquid wastes that cannot be recycled,\n such as paint, thinners, inks and varnishes, and Climafuel®; which is\nmade from household residual and commercial waste that would otherwise\ngo to landfill.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Climafuel used at South Ferriby is sourced from local suppliers such as <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.transwasteltd.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Transwaste<\/a>, as well as from <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.midukrecycling.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">MidUK Recycling<\/a>, <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.orchid-environmental.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Orchid Environmental<\/a> and <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.wastecycle.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Wastecycle<\/a>.\n In the past three months, more than 9,000 tonnes of waste that would\notherwise be landfilled have been used to make cement in South Ferriby.\nBased on the biomass content in alternative fuels, the plant has so far\nthis year also saved the equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions that\n 3,300 cars produce in a year.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plant director, Philip Baynes-Clarke, explained: \u201cThe use of\nalternative fuels at South Ferriby is one of our key focuses, and is\nimproving the sustainability of our operation.

      "Body": "<p>Year 4 pupils from St Peters C of E Primary School in Aylesford have\nbeen just completed working on a project investigating their local CEMEX\n quarry.  The project is being run by Groundwork Kent & Medway and\nhas been made possible by funding from the CEMEX UK Foundation as part\nof the company\u2019s corporate social responsibility program and efforts to\nwork more closely with local communities.<\/p>\n<p>The CEMEX Aylesford quarry is a working sand quarry and can process\nup to 1,000 tonnes a day of sand.  A key part of the project was the\nopportunity to visit the quarry. The class was given a full health and\nsafety briefing before visiting the site, so they learnt about the\ndangers a quarry site can hold.  At the site they got the chance to see\nall stages of the sand quarrying process from the initial extraction\nfrom the water using a dredger, through to the washing, sorting and\ndrying of the sand before it is bagged.   The pupils enjoyed seeing the\nmachinery at work close-up and especially getting the chance to wear the\n high-visibility jackets, hard hats and goggles!<\/p>\n<p>Michael Hinson, Quarry Manager at CEMEX\u2018s Aylesford Quarry said \u201cWe\nwere delighted to show the pupils round the site.  Quarries give\ncommunities valuable materials to build schools, hospitals, roads even\ndown to ingredients for toothpaste and china clay.  But they are working\n areas and can be dangerous, which is why we wear protective clothing\nall the time.  It was an opportunity to show the children the dangers\nthere are and why they shouldn\u2019t use the quarry as a playground.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Back in the classroom pupils have been further exploring the\ndifferent types of sand and their uses and looking at how quarries can\nbe restored, including designing their own restoration plan for the\nAylesford site.<\/p>\n<p>During the project they also explored the history of the CEMEX site,\nfinding out how sand quarrying has changed since the 1920\u2019s and also\nwhat fossils have been unearthed onsite.  During their quarry visit\npupils got the unique opportunity to look for their own fossils in the\nclay, finding ammonites and belemnites.  They were also shown some\nlarger examples of fossils which have been unearthed on the site during\nthe sand excavation.<\/p>\n<p>Karen Godsell, Class Teacher at St Peter's said \u201cWe all had a great\ntime at the quarry. We learnt lots about how it works and were very\nsurprised that it was all happening just behind our school! Finding the\nfossils was the highlight for the children and we are all inspired to\nfind out even more!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jenny Glanfield, Education Officer at Groundwork Kent & Medway\ncommented \u201cIt is great that CEMEX are fully supportive of the programme\nand have given us the opportunity to visit the quarry, enhancing many\naspects of the pupils learning.  Most of the children did not even\nrealise there was a quarry on their doorstep; the project helps the\npupils appreciate and understanding what is happening in their local\nenvironment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>ENDS<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editor:<\/p><ul><li>Groundwork Kent & Medway is part of a national federation of\ntrusts delivering sustainable regeneration projects where they are most\nneeded.

This\nproject diverts the water flow away from the reserve and into the River\nTrent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Today, there is a new eastern bank to the River Erewash and a channel\n south diverting the flow into the Trent. This has resulted in a much\ndepleted amount of water, an estimated 1% of the annual flow of water,\nspilling into the Eastern Lake.<\/p>\n\n<p>A key element of the project was the construction by CEMEX of a new\nweir which included a bridge, public footpath and fish \u201cladder\u201d. The\nweir is used to maintain the water levels in the nature reserve and stop\n debris entering the River Trent.<\/p>\n\n<p>The fish ladder allows the fish to pass from the River Trent, through\n the weir by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps,\ninto the River Erewash and the nature reserve on the other side. This is\n the first time in 50 years that fish have been able to swim into these\nstretches of water from this direction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The River Erewash is a channel approximately 10 metres wide with\nCEMEX operations that is, a ready mixed concrete plant, quarry and\nprocessing plant are on either side. Perpendicular to the River Erewash\nthere is a separate channel for barging the quarried sand and gravel\napprox 10km to the processing plant.  Currently 50 barges a week, each\ncarrying between 70 \u2013 80 tonnes, transport the aggregates.  CEMEX\nMaterials provided over 200 cubic metres ready mixed concrete and\naggregates from the local operations for this project.<\/p>\n\n<p>The construction of the embankment and diversion will minimize the\neffects of the contaminated phosphate and nitrogen-rich water that has\nbeen running in the River Erewash into the SSSI Attenborough Nature\nReserve.

It looks like shredded paper and\nconsists of paper, cardboard, wood, carpet, textiles and plastics that\nhave been through a treatment process. It is a solid, non-hazardous fuel\n from which recoverable materials have been removed for recycling.<\/p>\n<p>Since its introduction in February 2008, almost 130,000 tonnes of\nClimafuel has been used, produced from approximately 250,000 tonnes of\nwaste that would otherwise have gone to landfill. Based on the biomass\ncontent in the fuel, the use of Climafuel has also saved over 150,000\ntonnes of CO2, the same emissions as almost 60,000 cars produce in a\nyear.

      "Body": "<p><span class=\"globalHeader\">CEMEX opens new £49 million cement plant in the south east of England<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Global building materials company CEMEX today opened a new cement\ngrinding and blending plant at the Port of Tilbury in Essex. For CEMEX,\nwhich is the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, this shows a strong\ncommitment to the UK and sustainable construction. The £49 million\ninvestment, which has been under construction for the past two years, is\n the largest in the UK cement industry for five years, and the 1.2\nmillion tonne plant will increase CEMEX UK\u2019s cement capacity by 20%.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plant, which is the only cement plant in the South East of\nEngland, was officially opened by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State\n for Communities and Local Government, Shahid Malik, who is Minister for\n the Thames Gateway in the company of CEMEX\u2019s President of the Europe,\nMiddle East, Africa and Asia Region Juan Romero and 150 guests. Guests\nat the Tilbury opening ceremony included senior members of the\nconstruction industry and representatives from central and local\nGovernment and the European Parliament.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"I'm delighted that CEMEX chose to site their new plant in the Thames\n Gateway. The Gateway is renowned for attracting innovative businesses,\nhas strong trade and business links and a geographical position that\ngives the region ready access to a number of key markets for many\ncompanies. CEMEX's decision to base it's low-carbon sustainable plant in\n Tilbury will provide jobs and allow the company to reduce it's carbon\nfootprint even further by making use of the Gateway's water and rail\ntransport links,\u201d Mr Malik said.<\/p>\n\n<p>The basis for the products made at Tilbury is cement clinker, which\nis ground to a powder and blended with by-products from other industries\n to make cements for use in buildings and infrastructure projects. By\nreducing the amount of clinker in the blended cement, it enables every\ntonne of clinker to go further and lessens the overall impact of its\nmanufacture and makes it more sustainable.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plant boasts the first vertical cement mill in the country, which\n uses 20-40% less energy than traditional horizontal mills. The mill\ncombined with the blended cement capabilities, shipping, barge and rail\nloading facilities mean that the plant\u2019s carbon footprint per tonne of\nfinished product is further reduced.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX UK\u2019s President, Gonzalo Galindo, said: \u201cI am immensely proud of\n this plant, which truly demonstrates our commitment to the construction\n industry and confidence that the UK economy will bounce back. The\nenergy efficiency of the UK's first vertical cement mill combined with\nthe use of by products from other industries in our cements will\nsignificantly increase the sustainability of   our end products. Add to\nthat CEMEX's extensive network of London wharfs and depots, connected by\n a system of river and rail transport to further minimise emissions and\nrelieve the pressure on congested roads, and you have a strong\nenvironmental story.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The Tilbury facility marks a step-change in the industry by producing\n blended cements in purpose-built, factory-controlled conditions. This\nwill ensure quality control and product consistency, as well as safety\nfor a permanent and well trained 25 strong work force. Additional\nbenefits are likely to include increased productivity and reduction in\nenergy use and materials wastage.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<p>ENDS <\/p>\n\n\n<p>Notes to editors:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Information:<\/strong><br>\nFor further information and photographs contact:<br>\n<strong>Marit Meyer-Bell<\/strong><br>\nTel. 01932 583208 / 07867653392<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:marit.meyerbell@cemex.com\">marit.meyerbell@cemex.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>CEMEX:<\/strong><br>\nCEMEX is a global building materials company and leading supplier of\ncement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates.

Despite the economic downturn in the UK, and the\nconstruction industry suffering more than most, you only need look at\nthe products and processes showcased in CPIA to highlight the huge input\n the industry is making towards change.<\/p>\n\n<p>The industry is not always been good at trumpeting its own\nachievements.  However, CPIA demonstrates how the construction products\nindustry is continuously developing and improving by creating innovative\n solutions which make a significant impact to all aspects of\nconstruction?.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 24 entries in CPIA are under four key headings; Energy and Carbon\n Saving; Health, Safety and Security; Improvements in Site Safety; and\nResource Efficiency. By delivering these efficiencies, these new ideas\nbring a range of benefits to everyone including clients and end users,\ncompany employees and especially the environment we live in.<\/p>\n\n<p>The products featured in the publication cover a wide range and\ninclude processes designed to save energy and reduce emissions,\nproviding safer operations on site for employees and contractors and\nprovide a full sustainability appraisal of manufacturing operations.\nThis creative and innovative approach is not confined just to a select\nfew in one or two sectors, but can be seen as a key driver for an\nindustry that is continuously improving and constantly changing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to editors:<br>\n\nThe Construction Products Association represents the UK?s manufacturers\nand suppliers of construction products, components and fittings.

Rather than the pursuit of young\ntearaways,  motorcycling is conducted by mature individuals who are also\n quite likely to  own a car. While statistically they like to live\ndangerously once in a while,  the research suggests they would prefer to\n get from \u2018A to B\u2019 in one piece and  remarkably few claim to be reckless\n speed addicts.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, \u2018human error\u2019 remains the main cause of death and  injury\nbut poor road design and surface condition can be contributory factors.\n Motorcycling associations have shown widespread concern about these\nissues and  highways authorities across Europe have come under attack\nfrom the Federation  of European Motorcycling Associations (FEMA). FEMA\nhas even accused engineers  and maintenance staff of being unaware of\nthe hazards presented to riders.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the European Agenda for Motorcycle Safety, FEMA  highlights\nseveral problem areas which it feels require more attention. These\ninclude lack of friction of some asphalt types when wet, poor drainage\nwhich  increases the risk of aquaplaning and bad kerb design. Bituminous\n asphalt  sealers, potholes and the rutting caused by heavy lorries are\nalso singled out  for criticism. The biggest problems are, as might be\nexpected, with older  highways.<\/p>\n\n<p>Specialists within the <a href=\"/aa/aa_as.asp\">CEMEX UK<\/a>\n technical team are well  aware of these issues and point out that good\ndesign and construction practice  ensures highways are safer for all\nusers, not just motorcyclists.<\/p>\n\n<p>Roads are created by building up layers of different types  of coated\n stone. Basic construction comprises sub base, base, binder course and\nthe surface or \u2018wearing\u2019 course. The base courses have larger diameter\naggregate to help withstanding the heavy loads and to ensure the\nunderlying  ground is not subjected to stresses from the traffic. Modern\n surface course  formulations, such as stone mastic asphalt (SMA), are\nable to resist the  rutting often seen - and felt - on the inside\ncarriageway of major roads. The  final surface layer can be\ncomparatively thin and formed using sizes and types  of aggregate that\nprovide very good grip, even in wet weather, which is  imperative for\nthe motorcyclist.<\/p>\n\n<p>When correctly applied, these thin surfacings - including  Viatex and Viapave from <a href=\"/aa/aa_as_vi.asp\">CEMEX\u2019s  \u2018Via\u2019 range<\/a>\n - are also resistant to wear, which means fewer cracks or  potholes\ndevelop and less remedial work is needed between re-surfacing.\nHistorically, it is the remedial \u2018overbanding\u2019 with bitumen used in\ncrack  repairs and repairs to joints between running lanes that creates\nsmall, smooth  or \u2018slick\u2019 areas. These areas can catch out the unwary\nmotorcyclist, especially  in the wet. Under some conditions these\npatches are just as hazardous as the  unfilled cracks as this may\nundermine the motorcycle and its rider.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the past road builders relied on hot rolled asphalt or  macadam\n(sometimes tarmacadam, Bitmac or - incorrectly - just tarmac) as the\nmainstay for road construction.  The more  recent additions to the\n\u2018blacktop\u2019 list such as thin surfacing systems such as  CEMEX Viapave\nand Viatex, coupled with a range of proprietary brands, mean it is\npossible to design each road specifically for the type and amount of\ntraffic it  handles, particularly where heavy goods vehicles are\nconcerned.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take a 2km section of the M9 in Sterling, Scotland for  example. \nThis contract was one of the  first to be carried out by CEMEX Surfacing\n to newly introduced specifications  aimed at improving the durability\nof roads.   This was achieved in part by sealing the road against water\nthrough  techniques such as edge compaction; using an edge roller helps\nto close any  voids left through the traditional method of \u2018cutting\nback\u2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Detailed planning of all aspects of the project included  staggering\nthe joints, painting all joint faces, over-band sealing of the lower\nbase and binder course layers and placing a tack/bond coat between all\nlayers  to stop water penetrating the road.   Ensuring water runs off\nthe road, not into it, is an important factor in  reducing the problems\nhighlighted by FEMA.   While potentially uncomfortable for the car\ndriver, these faults tend to  be little more than inconvenient for the\nmotorist but can be a significant  hazard for the motorcyclist when they\n result in the appearance of potholes in  the surface of the\ncarriageway.<\/p>\n\n<p>In total, 34,000 tonnes of material was removed on this  section of\nthe M9 and the carriageway was reconstructed with 11,000 tonnes of\nrecycled sub base and 23,000 tonnes of bituminous material. While safety\n is  paramount, with this volume of materials and the design of the\nmaterials  installed (such as CEMEX Viapave and Viatex), improved road\npavement durability  and longevity also gives financial benefits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Motorcyclists can  justifiably claim their machines impose very\nlittle wear and tear on road  surfaces; however it is paramount in terms\n of safety that the motorcycle tyres  have as much contact with the road\n surface course layer particularly in wet  weather.  With the possible\nexception of  noise pollution, motorbikes are an eco-friendly form of\ntransport. The steady  expansion in motorcycle traffic can therefore be\nseen as a welcome trend. But  with an average of over 6000 motorcyclists\n killed or seriously injured each  years on British roads there is an\nobvious responsibility for all those  involved in road building - from\nthe planner to the asphalt supplier - to  consider their particular\nrequirements.<\/p>"

      "Image Banner": "",
      "Display Title": "The sustainable way to use aggregates",
      "Body": "<p><span class=\"globalHeader\">The sustainable way to use aggregates<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>The UK has an  abundant supply of <a href=\"/aa/aa_lp.asp\">aggregates<\/a>\n for use in building materials and construction projects but as the\nshift  towards sustainability gathers pace, interest in recycled sources\n has  increased.<\/p>\n\n<p>Across the  UK the demand for aggregates stands at approximately 275\nmillion tonnes per  year. Most of this is used in the manufacture of <a href=\"/re/re_lp.asp\">concrete<\/a> or concrete products,  such as <a href=\"/bp/bp_lp.asp\">blocks<\/a> and <a href=\"/bp/bp_pr_rp.asp\">railway sleepers<\/a> and for <a href=\"/aa/aa_as.asp\">asphalt<\/a>.\n Other uses include  drainage, bedding for pipework and decorative\nlandscaping as well as bases for  roads, paths and other surfaced areas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Primary <a href=\"/aa/aa_ba.asp\">aggregates<\/a>\nare drawn from 1,300  extraction sites on land or from offshore\ndredging. In many cases the haulages  distances are thus relatively\nshort. Nevertheless, recycled aggregate often has  a double advantage of\n being processed close to the building site where it can  be used and\nits re-use avoids the need for landfill, with its attendant  transport\ncost and environmental impact.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition  to recycled aggregate, secondary aggregates are also\nwidely used, especially in  concrete manufacture. These resources\ninclude waste materials such as slag from  the steel industry and\npulverised fuel ash (PFA) from coal fired power  stations. <a href=\"\">CEMEX<\/a>,\n the leading building  materials provider, is in the forefront of these\ndevelopments, creating  carefully formulated blends for high performance\n concrete.<br>\nThe company  is also pioneering the regular use of recycled concrete in\nits full range of  concrete mixes. For example, at the Gorton plant in\nManchester, 10% of crushed,  recycled concrete is used on a routine\nbasis and customers are increasingly  requesting details on this\nsignificant saving in primary aggregates. Indeed, it  was an important\nfactor in the supply of concrete to G & J Seddon for the\nconstruction of the new Glendining Primary School for Salford City\nCouncil. In  this case 800m3 of concrete was supplied; the recycled\nelement representing  the equivalent of 13 concrete mixer trucks worth\nof material.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is  actively involved in increasing the supply of all forms of\nrecycled aggregate,  from china clay waste in Cornwall to crushed glass\nand construction and  demolition waste across the UK. At quarries in the\n Bristol area, for instance,  CEMEX produces high quality recycled\naggregate (Type 1) - which can be used in  creating the base layer for\nroads and concrete surfaces - along with a range of  other recycled\naggregates for use as a \u2018Fill Material\u2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>At present  25% of the demand for aggregate is met through the use of\n recycled and  secondary materials. The Waste and Resources Action\nProgramme (WRAP) estimates  that the proportion of recycled aggregates\ncan be increased to 30% by 2011 and  the government gave this target\nfurther impetus in the 2009 budget with an  annual increase in the\nlandfill tax of £8 per tonne from 2011 to 2013. In  addition, the levy\non primary aggregates was increased to £2 per tonne.<\/p>\n\n<p>Increasingly,  public projects require a set percentage of recycled\nmaterial to be used. In  some instances this can be a substantial\nproportion, such as the in the \u2018Church  Village Bypass\u2019 in South Wales\nwhere the Welsh Assembly has imposed a  requirement for 45% recycled\naggregate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite the  excellent progress being made, barriers to using\nsustainable aggregates  remain.  For example, the quality of  crushed\nand graded rubble from building sites can vary between samples, making\nengineers cautious about using any form of recycled material where\ndefined  standards must be met. Confusion or inadequate understanding of\n cements  produced from recycled materials can also restrict uptake of\nsecondary  aggregates.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Research  into the use of recycled aggregates for use in making\nconcrete, concrete blocks  and as a sub base is ongoing around the\nWorld.   In the UK, pressure to develop more sustainable forms of\nconstruction is  helping to accelerate the process and is creating a\ndemand for more detailed  information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Industry  initiatives, such as those led by WRAP, support ongoing\nresearch and commercial  development The Aggregates Programme aims to\nincrease the availability of  sustainable aggregates by helping\ncompanies invest in reprocessing  infrastructure to produce higher\nquality recycled aggregates to meet market demand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quality  protocols have also been introduced to help users of\nrecycled aggregates  demonstrate that aggregate products have been fully\n recovered and are no longer  a waste. The programme also aims to\nprovide agreement on defined standards and  specifications, thus\nincreasing confidence in performance and providing a clear  \u2018duty of\ncare\u2019 audit trail to ensure compliance with waste management\nlegislation.<br>\nMany of  these measures are designed to break down barriers to using\nrecycled aggregates  and to encourage a positive position when tenders\nare drawn up and contracts  assigned.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, in  order to ensure the carbon footprint for construction\nmaterials really is  minimized on the building site, suitable materials\nmust be available locally.  For example, recent initiatives have made\nincreased quantities of high quality  recycled aggregate available in\nthe London  area but on rural sites, far from urban areas, primary\naggregates may still be  the \u2018greener\u2019 option.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another way  in which many major producers of sand, gravel, stone and\n other aggregates can  make the industry more sustainable is through\nincreased efficiency and improved  technology. Reduction in dust during\nthe processing stages is one area under  investigation and on its many\nquarries and extraction sites across the UK, CEMEX is  playing its part\nin raising standards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Overall the  UK  therefore has a good track record in the use <a href=\"/aa/aa_ba.asp\">of sustainable aggregates<\/a> as  well as in the drive towards developing new opportunities. <\/p>"

      "Body": "<p>Andy Nevitt, a screed flooring expert from CEMEX UK, the leading building materials provider, talks about what architects, developers and self builders need to know when choosing screeds to use over underfloor heating systems.<\/p><p>Underfloor heating systems have steadily grown in popularity with homeowners over the past decade with the underfloor heating trade association UHMA recording system installation numbers increasing year on year.<\/p><p>   Once reserved only for bigger developments such as hospitals and schools there has been a growing trend in recent years for house builders and developers to install underfloor systems as a first choice in new homes.<\/p><p>   They are easy and cost effective to install and can save the homeowner up to 30% on fuel bills compared to traditional hot water systems using radiators.\nHowever, despite its obvious benefits, there are many factors that need to be considered even before deciding to opt for an underfloor heating system. <\/p><p>One of the most important decisions is the material which would cover the system and will optimise the effectiveness of the system once installed.\nConsiderationsScreed has been identified as a perfect partner for underfloor system applications. <\/p><p> It encapsulates the under floor heating elements and diffuses the heat across the floor surface providing an even temperature in the room.\nBefore any architect or contractor specifies or installs an underfloor heating system, it is imperative that they understand which screed is best to use in a given situation and recognise the different methods of floor construction during the design stage.\n<\/p><p>The contractor should also consider different thickness requirements associated with specific screed types, how much room they have to lay the screed and how the floor will be insulated.\nLaying screedIt is vital to install the screed as early as possible in the construction process as the curing and drying of the product is critical to its long term performance.\n<\/p><p>The screed must be laid after the roof; window and external doors have already been installed to protect it from the elements of rain, wind and sun as this can have a detrimental effect on the product. It also ensures a more consistent environment for the initial curing. <\/p><p>  Once the screed has been laid, and depending on whether a self compacting or traditional mix is used, it is essential the product has been left to cure before it is dried.\nTraditional v Flowing screedsThe type of screed used will depend on the type of application. <\/p><p>The industry has tended to use a traditional Portland cement-based screed as opposed to the flowing variety which has a calcium sulfate binder.\nOver recent years architects and contractors have come to realise the benefits of using a flowing screed application compared to the traditional mix as they experience an improved end performance and cost savings.\n<\/p><p>Flowing Screeds\nCombining underfloor heating with flowing screeds offers significant benefits. However, it is essential that the heating system specified has been designed for use with flowing screeds.\nReduced screed thickness: the properties of a flowing screed mean that it can be laid at approximately half the thickness, around 50mm overall thickness compared to 90mm for sand/cement screed. <\/p><p>This results in less material but a stronger, more consistent quality and a neater finish.\nQuicker application: flowing screed can be laid at a faster rate than a sand /cement screed due to the thinner application and accuracy of placement. <\/p><p>A flowing screed will move around the pipe system giving void-free intimate contact that would be difficult to achieve using a sand/cement screed.\nEvenness of heat: The close contact of the screed with the heating system allows heat to spread evenly and reach an optimum temperature quicker. <\/p><p>Conversely when the heating is switched off, the screed also cools much quicker. The heating system is therefore more responsive and has improved energy efficiency compared to systems using traditional sand/cement screeds.\n<\/p><p>Time savings: Reduced curing times and its speed and efficiency of application means contractors can shave weeks off a project. Its ability to dry and cure quicker means the area is available sooner to other trades to continue working.\n<\/p><p>Finish: As flowing screed is self-compacting it also provides a smoother finish and there is also minimal lateral shrinkage because of the calcium sulfate binder.\nTraditional Screeds\nTraditional screed products should not be forgotten and there are some situations where they are preferable - the construction of wet rooms, commercial kitchens and shower areas are better suited to traditional mixes due to the continual contact with water and then drying out.  <\/p><p>The physical make-up of flowing screed means a constant contact with water could gradually debond and degrade it.\nFinishing Touches\nFinally, when the screed has been laid and dried it is best practice to prime or seal the top of the screed before a finish like tile or marble is applied as this will increase the effectiveness and preserve longevity of the screed.<\/p><p>For further information on screeds please visit:  www.CEMEX.co.uk/screed or call the Product Support Helpline on 0800 667 827\n<\/p><p>--Ends-- <\/p><p>Notes to editors:\n<\/p><p>CEMEX is a global building materials company and leading supplier of cement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates.

The new plant cost in excess of £1.2 million and includes an efficient full  reclaim system reducing the ongoing costs of the facility.\n<\/p><p>As  well as reusing water from the concrete process, the reclaim system ensures  that all cement, gravel and sand is reused and eliminates the requirement to  send waste materials to landfill.\nSimilarly, the new  Stepney plant is designed to produce very high volumes of concrete, in excess  of 180 cubic metres per hour in the most efficient and sustainable way. <\/p><p>The  twin mixer units are capable of producing higher strength concretes, such as 50  and 60N which are increasingly in demand by the market, and have built-in  \u2018recyclers\u2019 to significantly reduce waste disposal and recycle surface water in  the concrete mixes.\n<\/p><p>The £2.2million  facility is currently supplying materials to Laing O\u2019Rourke for the famous\u2018Walkie Talkie\u2019 skyscraper building at 20 Fenchurch Street  and to the Balfour Beatty Carillion Joint Venture (BBCJV) for the East London  Line.\n<\/p><p>Both  plants were part of CEMEX\u2019s major UK  investment programme, which this year alone included six other permanent  concrete plants and a new Dry Silo Mortar plant at Braintree  in Essex. <\/p><p><em>\u201cOur investment in these plants  demonstrates our commitment to the industry and is a key element in our drive  for efficiency and improved quality and service.

      "Body": "<p>Mortar is the glue in any building and is one of the many product lines that can be sourced at builders' merchants.  Steve Crompton, Technical Director for Readymix and Mortars  at building materials supplier, CEMEX UK, highlights a few of the essential areas to consider when it comes to servicing mortar requirements for the small end builder, and help merchants add real value to their ongoing relationships.<\/p><p>With any building project there are many factors to consider.  From the design-led issues of overall construction, down to the smallest finishing details.  Builders can often seek the advice of their merchant suppliers and their questions can be related to any number of issues across numerous products.  <\/p><p>To guarantee a good service and repeat visits by the customer, the merchant needs to match and, indeed, exceed customer expectations in terms of service. Choosing the right mortar for the job seems  to be straightforward but there are a number of logistical, aesthetic and technical areas that are worth considering.<\/p><p> The options will often be the choice of the builder, which may be influenced by the merchant.\nThe most basic consideration is the amount and type of brick or block work being used which will determine the type of mortar and the subsequent mortar specification ie the strength.\n<\/p><p><strong>Mortar Strength<\/strong> <\/p><p>The mortar choice will be based on several factors including the bricklayers' preference and the application.. Is it for above ground or below damp proof course level usage? What is the strength requirement to ensure the structural integrity and load bearing of the design?  Are there a number of courses and joint profiling in the design?  <\/p><p>All these issues will influence mortar choice and specification.\n<\/p><p>As a rule, in terms of strength, class one and two strength mortars are specified for below groundwork, often with semi engineering bricks that are very dense and inherently strong.  <\/p><p>Class three and four will be chosen for work above ground level which tends to utilise softer materials such as the common brick or other products such as thermalite blocks.\n<\/p><p><strong>Logistics<\/strong> <\/p><p>In addition to routine product ordering, the small-end builder may want assistance with the 'how' of a job.  Whilst most construction projects will involve mixing on site, in some instances it may be beneficial to consider offering delivery of small quantities of ready spread which can be supplied as class three strength mortar ready mixed and available in disposable bags.\n<\/p><p>Many companies including CEMEX will take orders for as little as just one tub of a ready spread mix which will, for instance, provide enough material to lay up to 350 bricks.  <\/p><p>Such a service can be extremely convenient for the builder who is struggling to find room for an on-site mixer set-up.  Merchants can help in this regard by pointing out the availability of this service and undertaking the ordering on behalf of the builder, some of whom may be unaware that such solutions exist for smaller scale projects.\n<\/p><p><strong>Mortar colouring matching<\/strong><\/p><p>Another mortar area in which the merchant can add value is that of mortar colour matching.  On projects such as adding an extension, or constructing a conservatory at an existing plot, matching the mortar colour already in situ can become an important element for the builder and, ultimately, the end client's satisfaction with the finished job. <\/p><p>Again, a number of companies, including CEMEX, can offer a comprehensive mortar colour matching service which can be accessed via merchants, thereby allowing them to take their relationship beyond just supplying product  and into guidance, sourcing and eventual solution.  <\/p><p>There are now a significant number of bespoke coloured mortars available to suit all types of projects and the builders' merchant can add real value in this process.\n<\/p><p><strong>Specialist products<\/strong><\/p><p>Finally, merchants can help around the sourcing of more specialist products used in traditional mortar, such as the provision of limesand.  <\/p><p>Such products can be purchased and delivered to site in up to seven tonne skips and can help satisfy the builder who wishes to mix on-site and is confident of succeeding when it comes to achieving a more natural colour match where such raw materials are used.\n<\/p><p>The merchant can act as the conduit between manufacturer and builder to ascertain what is required for a specific smaller-end project and achieve the solution for the customer.\nFrom supplier to customer via the merchant.<\/p><p>Mortar requirements for the small-end builder can, in their own way, present similar sorts of technical, logistical and aesthetic challenges as some of the biggest construction projects. It is just the scale that is different.  Small-end builders can now benefit from the range of mortar solutions that exist, and whether they need help in delivery, sourcing or simply securing the correct raw materials they need, the builders\u2019 merchant can play a pivotal role and ensure his customer returns time and time again.<\/p><p><!--\n\n\n\tPRESS RELEASE FOR ISSUE TO:\n\tProfessional Builders Merchant\n\n\n\tWITH/WITHOUT PHOTOGRAPH:\n\t\n\n\n\tFOR ISSUE ON:\n\t\n\n\n\tFOR APPROVAL BY:\n\t\n\n\n\tDEADLINE FOR APPROVAL:\n\tAugust 12\n\n\n\tACCOUNT HANDLER RESPONSIBLE:\n\tAnas Kasak\n\n\n\tACCOUNT DIRECTOR APPROVAL:\n\tWill Ryan\n\n\n\tTARGET MEDIA:\n\tProfessional Builders Merchant\n\n\n\tKEY MESSAGES:\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tExperts in mortar\n\t\t\tWorking in partnership\n\t\t\tProduct choice and innovation\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tCLIENT APPROVAL SIGNATURE:\n\tDate: July 08\n\n\n-->--Ends--<\/p>"

      "Body": "<p>Building materials solutions company CEMEX has announced plans for a new plant that would receive residual household and commercial waste and transform it into a sustainable green fuel, referred to by CEMEX as Climafuel.<\/p><p>The new plant, which could divert up to 75% of Warwickshire\u2019s future waste from landfill and turn it into a valuable fuel for cement-making could be built at the company\u2019s former works site in\n\n\nSoutham or at Malpass  Farm adjacent to the current cement plant in Rugby, Warwickshire. <\/p><p>\nCEMEX has now  submitted two applications for a Climafuel plant to Warwickshire County  Council, one at Southam (August) and one for Malpass Farm (September). While  only one plant would be built, these alternatives which are equally suitable,  will give the Council and its citizens the opportunity to decide on the option  that best matches local needs and complements the County\u2019s future waste  strategy.\n<\/p><p>The  investment, which is estimated to total £35 million, would create 25  full-time jobs, and demonstrates CEMEX\u2019s continued  commitment to Rugby, where cement has been  produced since 1865. <\/p><p>Provided permission is granted, the Climafuel plant  would have the capacity to receive around 300,000 tonnes of local waste per  annum, to satisfy approximately 60% of Rugby  works\u2019 Climafuel needs.\nThe proposed  Climafuel plant production process would take place in fully enclosed buildings  and use mechanical biological treatment technology (MBT), which accelerates the  work of natural bacteria within the waste, to produce a dry and clean material  that burns well.\n<\/p><p><em>\"Reuse  and recycling will always be the first choice, but MBT is a complementary  option. It provides a more sustainable solution to the significant and increasing  challenge of reducing UK  landfill for non recyclable material,\u201d<\/em> according to CEMEX UK\u2019s sustainability director,  Andrew Spencer.\nCement-making is  energy intensive and involves heating up kilns to at least 1400 degrees. <\/p><p> Increasing the use of alternative fuels made from waste is therefore key to  saving fossil fuels for future generations. Alternative fuels are also more  economical and have significant environmental benefits, including a marked  reduction in emissions of oxides of nitrogen,  which in Rugby have reduced by more than 40%  since the plant introduced chipped tyres as a fuel in 2005.\n<\/p><p>Alternative fuels, such as tyres and Climafuel, also contain a  proportion of carbon neutral biomass content, thereby reducing the carbon  footprint of the cement-making process. The Climafuel produced at the proposed  CEMEX plant could contain at least 50% biomass and displace nearly 180,000  tonnes of fossil fuel CO2 in Rugby, the same  emissions as 72,000 cars produce in a year.\n<\/p><p>Provided  planning permission is granted, CEMEX plans to enter into an agreement with a  specialist waste management company to run the plant, which could be up and  running by 2010. <\/p><p>\nFor more  information about this project, please visit our exhibition outside CEMEX House  in October 23rd (2.00 \u2013 6.00 pm), 24th (2.00 \u2013 6.00 pm)  or 25th (10am-2pm).

      "Display Title": "Looking At Concrete In A New Light As A Sustainable Building Material",
      "Body": "<p>Concrete has  traditionally endured a poor reputation as a fundamental building material due  to perceptions concerning its reliance on virgin raw materials and the energy  consumption and emissions associated with its production process. <\/p><p> Based on recent developments, CEMEX UK\u2019s Technical Director, Steve Crompton, argues  that concrete should, instead, be viewed as a sustainable, strong,  long-lasting, versatile and economically important construction material that  has a vital part to play in the UK\u2019s  development of more sustainable communities.<\/p><p>\n  Concrete  is the most widely used construction material in the world. It is all around  us; from offices to schools, roads to railways and dams to homes. Its powerful  economic sway sees over 40,000 people directly employed in its UK  manufacture, and it supports a construction industry employing seven per cent  of our population.<\/p><p>  However, when it comes  to considering its sustainable credentials, which will ensure that we balance  our current rate of development with the resource requirements of future  generations, it is important to look at ready-mix concrete from several  angles:  its environmental and lifecycle  aspects, its economic impact and its contribution to our society in general.\n  Taking  the environmental aspect first. <\/p><p>There is clear evidence that improvements in  environmental performance are underway to minimise the impact of concrete production.  These changes include actively reducing the  emissions associated with the concrete manufacturing process, and lower the  reliance on virgin raw materials by increasing the use of by-products in  concrete. <\/p><p>Add in better management of waste, the use of more recycled  aggregates and alternative fuels,  as well as the thermal mass of concrete, which in the face of climate change,  can help keep future housing cooler in summer than lightweight houses, whilst  also saving heating fuel in winter, it is clear that concrete has a fundamental  part to play in helping to deliver the energy efficient buildings of the future. <\/p><p>\n  While  total construction industry impact accounts for 10 per cent of total UK CO2  emissions, concrete is responsible for just 2.6 per cent of this. Compared to  the 33 per cent generated by transport, this is a relatively small amount,  especially considering its importance as a basic construction material. <\/p><p> Concrete also comes out favourably when compared to structural steel, where the  amount of CO2 generated per tonne is approximately 10 times greater  than that of reinforced concrete.\n<\/p><p>  The  use of waste products from other industries, such as ground blast furnace slag  or fly ash, either as a mixer addition or incorporated in factory-blended cement significantly reduces the  overall greenhouse gas emissions, and means that this essential building  material is, and will continue to make, a significant contribution to the  Government\u2019s UK Climate Change Programme of driving down CO2 emissions by 60  per cent by 2050.\n<\/p><p>  In  addition to actively consuming waste products from other industries and  processes, the industry is working towards improving production plants and  compliance with international standards, such as ISO 14001, to prevent  pollution and ensure continual improvement through the implementation of environmental  management systems (EMS). <\/p><p>Use of recycled  water at production plants is also on the increase and is increasingly  commonplace.\n  It\u2019s  not only the environmental aspects of concrete that should be assessed as  sustainable and positive, however, so let\u2019s  consider its overall lifecycle.\n  Like  other building materials, concrete has a life span.  <\/p><p>When compared to other commonly used  construction materials it is by far the most durable, with a typical design  life of at least 60 years.  It  essentially has three phases of life.   Its creation, its use in buildings and structures, and its reuse through  recycling once the building comes to the end of its life.\n  It  is far more likely that a modern concrete building will be deemed obsolete due  to no further perceived usage, than the concrete fabric of the structure having  failed due to age. With this in mind,  and with cost-efficiency and sustainability now to the fore, reuse of concrete  buildings is ever more commonplace. <\/p><p>The material offers flexibility and seemingly  redundant concrete structures can be worked on, redesigned and rebuilt with new  up-to-date specifications.  However, if  demolished, the resulting aggregate can also be used for a number of  applications as a ready-made and important recycled material. <\/p><p>\n  Contrary  to popular belief, all rubble does not end up in landfill after a building\u2019s  demolition. Anything up to 95 per cent of a building\u2019s components can in fact  be recycled, including the most heavily reinforced concrete.<\/p><p>\n  Indeed,  recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) has proven performance characteristics and  is being used in the ongoing production of new concrete \u2013 thus completing its  life circle.  New European Standards have  cleared the way for greater use of recycled concrete aggregates in the manufacturing  process, supporting UK Government targets of increasingly meeting construction  demand with material from secondary and recycled sources.\n  From  an economic point of view, concrete and its sustainable credentials are well  matched. <\/p><p> To improve their sustainability  credentials, products should be consumed as near to the place of production as  possible. This country\u2019s self sufficiency in providing the core materials  required for concrete production means that inbound raw material transport and  import levels are kept to a minimum. <\/p><p>  More often than not, the concrete industry uses locally sourced  materials for local construction projects, thereby minimising transport related  impacts. Compare this to timber, which imports over 98 per cent of the total volume  used in UK  construction.\n<\/p><p>  With  increased pressure on conserving fossil fuels, such as coal, for future  generations, rising energy costs and changes to our climate, concrete can  contribute positively by offsetting the heating up of buildings (especially in  summer). Concrete\u2019s high thermal mass can help absorb the heat generated by  people, computers, lighting and electrical equipment, and keep internal  temperatures lower. <\/p><p>\n  The  thermal mass in concrete walls and floors stores energy from the sun and the  building\u2019s own heating system, and releases this at night, thereby sustaining  warmer overnight temperatures and reducing the need for heating.\n  Finally,  from an economic standpoint, as a self-sufficient producer of this material and  a UK  net exporter of concrete and component materials, concrete more than holds its  own against other important materials.\n<\/p><p>  Concrete  offers many virtues to our society as a whole.   It produces natural light when used in exposed areas within a structure,  and reduces the need for artificial lighting. It is naturally inorganic and  inert, and does not need treatment with additional toxic chemicals. It has  inbuilt fire resistance and offers secure characteristics due to its strength  and robustness, and will last for a minimum of 60 years with little or no  maintenance. <\/p><p>There is no process of natural decay, which bodes well for future  predicted environmental changes, and as a material for buildings is well  regarded by designers and the public alike, who according to research, view masonry  built houses as having the longest life expectancy of all construction options.\n  Sustainability  is no longer an issue of choice, but must be considered at the very heart of  ongoing development for our society.<\/p><p> Assessing the sustainable credentials of products  is a complex business and must take into consideration their combined  environmental, economic and social impact and performance.\n  As  illustrated here, concrete is a fundamental building material which combined environmental,  economic and social performance is strong. It therefore has a critical role to  play in delivering more sustainable communities, by reducing emissions and  providing long-lasting, secure as well as cost and energy efficient buildings  for the future.\n<\/p><p>  We  in the cement and readymix  concrete industries are proud of the essential role we have played in  creating Britain\u2019s built environment and are positive that our industry has a  lot more to contribute in the future to the further development of sustainable  building materials.<\/p><p> --Ends--<\/p><p>\n  Notes to  editors:\n  CEMEX is a global building materials company and leading supplier of cement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates.

This index is an aggregate measure of the emissions to air from the main  stack. <\/p><p>The increased use of tyres has shown that these have declined further at  this higher rate of usage. Most noticeable is the reduction in the emissions of  oxides of nitrogen by 26%. Since the start of tyre use as a fuel at the Rugby works, emissions of oxides of nitrogen have reduced  by around 40% and the use of fossil fuels has fallen by 24%.\n<\/p><p>  CEMEX was originally granted a permit by the Environment Agency to use  chipped tyres at the rate of three tonnes per hour in February 2007 following a  successful trials programme, which demonstrated distinct environmental benefits  of using tyres. Tyres have been used at the plant on a continuous basis since  that time. <\/p><p>\n  The disposal of the 40 million tyres scrapped each year in the UK  remains a problem for society and land-filling has been outlawed for some time.  Their use as an alternative fuel is part of the solution which brings with it significant  environmental advantages.\n<\/p><p>  The wider alternative fuels programme at Rugby and other CEMEX plants is making a considerable  contribution to improved environmental performance. Both tyres and other  alternative fuels, such as Climafuel, which is derived from household residual  waste and commercial waste, help to reduce  emissions. They also help save fossil fuels for the future and reduce the  carbon footprint associated with the cement-making process, as well as preserving  employment and improving plants\u2019 competitiveness. <\/p><p>At Rugby, the draft report clearly  demonstrates that the use of tyres has produced positive results, and early  indications are that the current Climafuel programme is producing similar  results.<\/p><p>\n  The report is available on the company\u2019s website - www.cemex.co.uk  - at Rugby Borough Council and Rugby Library.<\/p><p> Comments should be sent in writing, in the first instance, to Ian Southcott,  CEMEX House, Rugby CV21 2DT  or by email to ian.southcott@cemex.com. <\/p><p>The closing  date for comments is Friday 18 July.<\/p><p>--Ends--<\/p><p>    NOTES TO EDITORS\n  CEMEX UK\n    CEMEX is a global  building solutions company and leading supplier of cement, ready-mixed concrete  and aggregates.

This paving allows surface water to pass through the voids in the block design into a sub grade or drainage system, where it can be effectively managed.\n<\/p><p>In recent years, the number of areas such as roads, pavements and buildings which are sealed by impermeable materials has increased.  Rainfall which would normally be absorbed and retained by the ground is now often diverted off the sealed area, into the sewers and rivers.  This results in the overload of sewers, river flooding and the risk of pollution into the water course.\n<\/p><p>Use of ReadyflowTM with SUDS allows a specified amount of water to be retained and then discharged in a controlled manner leading to reduced rainfall into sewers, cleaner rivers and streams, less pollution, improved ground water levels and water and air to the plant and tree roots. <\/p><p>The unique design of the 80mm block was created exclusively for CEMEX and is available in three colours Charcoal, Natural Grey and Burnt Ember (deep red).\n<\/p><p>The environmental credentials of this new block extend beyond their usage as it is made from CEMEX CEM 3 cement.

Every year, each of us uses the equivalent of 4.8 tonnes of aggregates which goes into houses, roads, hospitals and such everyday items as toothpaste and crockery.\n<\/p><p>\nTo minimise traffic and noise, the sand and gravel would be transported from the extraction area to the processing plant within the quarry, by a proposed conveyor to be laid under Longwater Road.

Many of them are mature, oak trees with some ash and willow, which mark the lines of former hedgerows.

It works by extracting dust from gases produced in the cement kiln and has been installed on the plant's exhaust duct to provide a physical barrier to the dust as it passes from the kiln to the chimney.\t<\/p><p>\n\nThe filter is a bit like a vacuum cleaner, though it works with more than 6,000 bags, each six metres long and made of highly effective Teflon-coated fibreglass. <\/p><p>The big difference when compared with a vacuum cleaner is that dust is collected on the outside rather than inside of the bag.

Rugby Works\nCEMEX's Rugby Works is one of the most modern cement plants in the world and represents a total investment of £200 million. It has the largest kiln in the UK and has a production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes of cement per annum. CEMEX supports 730 local jobs in Rugby (183 at the works), contributes £25.5 million per annum to the local economy and provides a product that is essential locally and nationally, for housing, hospitals, schools and roads. Every year Rugby produces enough cement for the construction of more than 72,000 houses (assuming that an average house contains approximately 18 tonnes of cement). For more information, please see www.CEMEX.co.uk/communities\n\n<\/p><p>4. The bag filter\nThe bag filter is positioned on the giant exhaust duct, which runs the entire height of the pre-heater tower. Two tubular steel duct sections weighing in at 17 tonnes each, the equivalent weight of nearly 700 people, were fabricated to connect the filter system. Lifting the new heavyweight sections into place was a major task. Hampered by high winds, a mammoth 70-metre reach crane, one of the largest mobile cranes available, carefully guided the two sections into place to complete the job.\n\n5. Tyre substitution\nAt Rugby tyres constitutes an energy replacement of 12%.\n\n6.

Data showed a marked reduction in certain emissions from the chimney while tyres were in use.<\/p>\n\n<p>A report with the results from the 1,000 hour tyre programme that was completed in December 2005 describes Rugby plant's successful performance against each of seven critical success factors identified in the Work's permit (IPPC Permit BL7248).<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX UK invited all interested parties to comment on a draft version of the report, before presenting a final copy to the Environment Agency, requesting permission to use tyres permanently.<\/p>\n\n<p>Increasing the use of alternative fuels is key to improving CEMEX's sustainability performance. In addition to the direct environmental benefits of reduced emissions, using alternative fuels, like tyres, have indirect benefits, such as recovering energy from what would otherwise be considered a waste material. Each year 40 million tyres are scrapped in the UK. Using alternative fuels at Rugby Works could help to minimise illegal dumping and preserve fossil fuels for future generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Data show that the Rugby plant operates well within current emission limits, but to improve this even further, the plant is installing a new dust filter during its annual maintenance shut down in February. The filter, which is expected to lead to a further 40 per cent reduction of particulate emissions, is being installed on the kiln exhaust, and will use 6,000 fabric bags to place a physical barrier between process gases and the atmosphere. <\/p>\n\n<p>The new filter combined with the use of tyres will in the future contribute to enhance Rugby's environmental performance and help ensure that quality cement from the plant is provided as sustainably as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>--Ends--<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to editors:\n\n<\/p><p>1.

The new £635million, 4 mile long tunnel will handle around 39 million tonnes of sewage a year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>From concrete mix design to delivery and placement CEMEX has worked with joint venture MVB, Morgan Sindall, Vinci Construction Grands Projects and Bachy Soletanche to provide a number of bespoke concrete mix designs.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is one of the most complicated infrastructure projects of recent years. Even before work began on site in autumn 2010 we had to look at every eventuality with the concrete and how performance might be affected.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe carried out trial mixes at our National Technical Centre and on site reviewing amongst others, cement designation and content, maximum aggregate size and admixture combinations. &nbsp;We had to be sure the mixes would be usable and retain consistence even when they had been skipped down the shaft or pumped onto the concrete train,\u201d explains Richard Kershaw, National Technical Manager, CEMEX UK Readymix.<\/p>\n\n<p>Starting with the diaphragm walls of the outer shaft, the concrete used was a C50/60 grade mix incorporating 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag &nbsp;(GGBS)as a cement replacement. Within this outer shaft the main inner lining was cast as a 750mm thick concrete cylinder. The outstanding aspect was a 29 day<s> <\/s>continuous pour. A total of 11,000 cubic metres was delivered in three skips on rotation using a C50/60 36% GGBS cement replacement mix reinforced with more than 500 tonnes of steel fibre.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the tunnel itself &nbsp;CEMEX worked with MVB to develop a solution to the scheme\u2019s requirements for the secondary lining. The primary lining was a precast system whilst the secondary lining was a 300mm thick steel fibre reinforced lining cast in-situ within two 30.6 metre shutters reducing the previously bored 7.8m internal diameter to 7.2m. The lining was built along the complete 7km tunnel.<\/p>\n\n<p>For this part of the project, after months of trials the team developed a concrete that would retain consistence for up to six hours, contained Dramix 5D steel fibres at 40Kg/m<sup>3<\/sup>, develop early compressive strength and flow for 15m without any segregation.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cLee Tunnel was a challenging project in which the design and technology of the concrete was pushed to the limit. The concrete was essential to help build an exceptional structure needed by the people of London\u201d, concludes Richard.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"

An innovative moveable scaffold system (MSS) has been used by Merseylink to build the concrete approach viaduct decks and the CEMEX team in partnership with the contractors, is providing the technically demanding concrete and supply expertise.<br />\n<br />\nThe MSS is 157m long, 22m wide, weighs 1700 tonnes and is a giant section of formwork, enabling the project team to cast deck spans of up to 70m at every location.&nbsp; Once poured the MSS jacks itself forward to the next span.<br />\n<br />\nEach deck span requires more than 1000m3 of concrete and has a complicated cross-section. Therefore, every pour requires a similarly exacting placement pattern to ensure the C50/60 concrete hardens homogeneously across the deck. Using CEMI and a bespoke admixture combination will ensure, consistence retention, where required and high early age compressive strength.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cMersey Gateway is a highly complex engineering project and one of the biggest in Europe, for which we, in partnership with Merseylink, have developed a suite of concrete mixes that will meet the performance criteria for this amazing infrastructure.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThe approach deck span requires a consistent C50/60 concrete with two hour consistence retention and 32 MPa at 36 hours to enable post-tension stressing\u201d comments Richard Kershaw, CEMEX National Technical Manager.<br />\n<br />\nThe continuous pour of 1148 cu metres was fed by two mobile batching plants set up by the CEMEX engineers close to the construction sites. These have been established one on each side of the river, to accommodate work on the scheme.

The new dredger will be the first new CEMEX vessel in 20 years, representing significant investment and ensuring supply of vital sand and gravel into the construction market.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe vessel, which will be built at Damen Shipyards Galati, in Romania, is designed to extract sand and gravel from the sea bed up to depths of 55 metres, including in the challenging conditions experienced in the North Sea. The dredger is the result of extensive market research and customer consultation which highlighted that the UK dredging industry has an aging fleet with increased focus by the market on the need for marine dredging.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nCEMEX UK has a pre-existing relationship with Damen, having utilised the service of Damen Shiprepair Amsterdam for maintenance of their vessels.&nbsp; When approaching Damen, CEMEX had a clear set of requirements, as Laurence Dagley, Director CEMEX UK Marine explains: \u201cWe wanted a cutting edge design, something for the 21st century with all the safety, efficiency, environmental and on board comfort credentials this implies.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<em>\u201cAchieving a maximum uptime within what can be a challenging working environment is also important to us. Damen accepted the challenges that we gave them, delivering a robust, yet innovative design that demonstrates the combined experience and ingenuity of our respective teams. Proudly wearing CEMEX colours, this new ship represents the start of our ambition to modernise our fleet over the coming years, to serve the increasing need for marine dredged aggregates in the UK.\u201d<\/em><br />\n<br />\nThe MAD 3500 dredger will replace CEMEX\u2019s Sand Heron and will give an additional 20% of aggregates that can be delivered per trip. Further design features include optimal balance between payload and efficiency, overall length of 103.5 metres, a deadweight of just under 7,000 tonnes and a maximum loaded speed of approximately 12 knots.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;The MAD 3500 will also have exceptional seakeeping behaviour, offering crew comfort in rough seas and the capability to work in heavy weather conditions. The bow is enclosed, protecting deck equipment and the \u201cuser-friendly\u201d design ensures relatively simple maintenance and part replacement to maximise non-operational time.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nDamen regional sales director, Frank de Lange says:<em> \u201cWe are honoured to work with CEMEX UK on this innovative project. At Damen we are always happy to embrace a challenge and this vessel, which includes a number of never before seen features is a good example of that.

The CLOCS standard seeks to reduce this number in three ways:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>by reducing the imbalance between on-site health and safety and work-related road risk;<\/li>\n\t<li>encouraging wider adoption of best practice across the logistics industry;<\/li>\n\t<li>improving the safety of vehicles.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>To further demonstrate the need for CLOCS, RoadPeace is giving a voice to people who have been injured or bereaved by construction vehicles, as part of this campaign.<\/p>\n\n<p>Victoria Lebrec, RoadPeace spokesperson and victim of a construction lorry crash, says \u201cIn 2014 my life changed forever when I was hit by a tipper truck whilst cycling in London. I lost my leg in the collision, and have had over 12 operations and months of physiotherapy. I urge all construction companies to join up to CLOCS and take on board some simple, effective methods to make their vehicles safer. If signing up means saving someone the pain I went through, then it is absolutely worth it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Taylor, Health and Safety Director CEMEX UK says; \u201cWe are delighted to be involved in this video and would encourage everyone in our industry who isn\u2019t a member of CLOCS to become members. Over the years, the construction industry has shown great commitment and done an excellent job of raising health and safety standards on sites. Now it is time to go beyond the sites themselves to roads and site access to raise the level of safety by sharing best practice and implementing innovation and change.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Derek Rees from CLOCS says \u201cI am delighted that RoadPeace and CEMEX UK have joined forces to create a hard-hitting video calling on others within the sector to join up to the scheme. As an industry, the construction sector takes health and safety on site really seriously. But very few clients, principal contractors and sub-contractors seem to recognise their legal and moral responsibilities for the vehicles servicing their sites. As soon as that lorry leaves the site the same rules don\u2019t seem to apply. The CLOCS scheme is a way of introducing workable solutions which help everyone in the industry protect the wider community, their colleagues and themselves.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>--Ends--<\/p>\n\n<p>Contact information<br />\nRachel Alcock, RoadPeace Lorry Danger Campaigner<br />\n07975 951850<br />\nRachel.alcock@roadpeace.org<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editor<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The video produced by RoadPeace featuring CEMEX UK can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNnH76wIu2w&amp;feature=youtu.be A version of the video with subtitles for use on social media can be found here: https://youtu.be/CxkFZ5dk0gA<\/li>\n\t<li>RoadPeace is the national charity for road crash victims in the UK.

      "Body": "<p><em>\u201cCEMEX Go Innovation is the perfect name for our new vessel. As a global company we are embracing new technologies and innovations, pushing the bounderies. 2017 saw the launch of CEMEX Go, a digital customer platform to buy, track orders and pay for building materials, a \u2018first\u2019 in our industry. This dredger also is a \u2018first\u2019 and includes many ground breaking innovations in its design, so what better name?\u201d<\/em> comments Laurence Dagley, Director Marine Aggregates.<\/p>\n\n<p>The design aspects of CEMEX Go Innovation has been developed to give major environmental savings while ensuring safety, high performance and sustainability. The result is a dredger which will have a 25% increased capacity, nearly double the dredging depth and discharge rate increase of 20%.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the major innovations is the dredging system which has no inboard pipework. All the pipework is external, something which has never been incorporated in a vessel of this size.<\/p>\n\n<p>The corrosive nature of the material that is dredged means that holes are frequently occurring in the extensive pipework. External pipework makes the system safer by reducing the risk of flooding internally and gives an easily accessible, more maintenance-friendly system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Maintanence is made easier and less costly with the help on an onboard crane. It is estimated that this innovative system will give an 80% reduction in expensive replacement components.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Go Innovation is being built and designed, in collaboration with the Engineering team of CEMEX Marine, &nbsp;by the Damen Shipyards Group of Rotterdam and built at the Damen Shipyards Galati in Romania.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to editors:<\/p>\n\n<p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com\" target=\"\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> | t: 01932 583214. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/li>\n\t<li>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people<\/li>\n\t<li>We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX: CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

The new grinding and blending facility at Tilbury will be officially opened in September.<\/p>\n\n<p>Iso-veyors, a more sustainable bulk transport system, were previously used by the company to transport materials to T5 at Heathrow airport. The system provides a logistical and flexible alternative to traditional silos providing storage for 28 tonnes of material per unit which can be transported by any combination of road, rail or ship.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cylinder- shaped containers are filled at source, West Burton power station in Lincolnshire, and transported by rail approx 170 miles to Tilbury in East London. It is anticipated that this transport solution will save 600,000 road miles and 720 tonnes CO2, the difference between road and rail transportation, per annum.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once at Tilbury, the 30ft containers, which have been constructed within the frame dimensions of a standard commercial container, are handled as standard ISO containers, utilising skeletal trailers and conventional rolling stock. They are placed on trucks to go into a storage area until required where they can be stacked three units high and moved using conventional lifting gear.<\/p>\n\n<p>This system provides flexible weatherproof storage, eliminates cross contamination and reduces environmental damage.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cFrom an operations perspective, the Iso-veyors enables us to move far larger loads over greater distances in less time, giving environmental benefits. It also ensures that we always have a constant supply of P-FA. We are continually looking for innovations that are also more sustainable, Iso-veyors and the recent successful introduction of the Epod,(electronic proof of delivery) fulfil&nbsp;these criteria \u201d, comments Graham Russell, Vice President Commercial, Logistics and Building Products.<\/p>\n\n<p>- ends \u2013<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:<\/p>\n\n<p>For photographs or more information, please contact Elizabeth Young, Communications t. 01932 583214 e. <a href=\"mailto:elizabeth.young@cemex.com\">elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Pulverised-fuel ash to BS 3892 Part 1 (P-FA) is the processed residue derived from power stations and used as a cement replacement.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials solutions company and leading supplier of cement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates.

This creates a more closed, even surface rather than the more textured appearance of a natural RCC. The smooth cement paste created during this process offers increase abrasion resistance making it attractive for high stress areas.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis contract was a great achievement for us \u2013 it was the largest area we have laid in the UK with RCC and it was an opportunity for us to use power floating for the first time. For the customer it gives a pavement which combines the strength and durability of concrete with the ease of construction of an asphalt. RCC alone can provide significant cost savings, up to 30% over traditional pavements and now with power floated RCC it offers a significantly harder wearing surface that\u2019s more aesthetically pleasing\u201d comments Garry Gregory, Director Asphalt and Paving Solutions, CEMEX UK.<\/p>\n\n<p>GPS PE Pipe Systems is a market leading manufacturer of high performance pipe products for gas, water, sewage and industrial applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centres, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ends<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Notes to editors:<\/b><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.young@cemex.com\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t: 01932 583214.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website <a href=\"http://www.cemex.co.uk\">www.cemex.co.uk<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 <\/b>CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.

Other finds include finely worked, leaf-shaped flint arrowheads, serrated blades, stone axes and grinding stones.<\/p>\n<p>About 80 Neolithic monuments have been identified in Britain, but Archaeologists are particularly excited by this one as they expect to uncover the entire circuit of the enclosure.

Expert speakers contributed on current issues related to nature conservation. The event showcased some of the best examples of Quarry restoration and wildlife conservation anywhere in Europe that were entered for the MPA Restoration Awards and the MPA Biodiversity Awards in association with Natural England.  A series of outstanding images were also presented as part of the MPA\u2019s Nature Photo competition. The MPA also launched Quarrywatch which will involve focused nature surveys at designated locations to gain a picture of the species colonising restored quarries and other nature sites. Local wildlife groups, individual enthusiasts and schools will also be invited to take part in the initiative.　<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Commenting, Nigel Jackson, Chief Executive of the MPA, said: \u201cOnce again MPA members\u2019 have demonstrated what an environmentally responsible industry can do to both protect existing and create new habitats. We could not be more proud to showcase what can be achieved by an industry that is uniquely placed to make a net gain to biodiversity.\u201d　<\/p>\n\n<p>MPA members are planning to increase the area of priority habitats on restored sites from 6,000 hectares currently to around 9,000 hectares in coming years, and increase the length of hedgerows planted from 79 km to 237 km.  The area of priority habitat would be equivalent to the size of Cardiff, and hedgerow would stretch from London to Cardiff.<\/p>"

The site has been used by CEMEX for 26 years and employs 90 onsite staff.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Manufacturing large concrete sleepers and crossing bearers requires heavy machinery, with the product often moving around this busy site.  Adhering to strict health and safety procedures at all times is understandably essential for the safety of everyone on site. Terry Gillooly, Washwood Heath Site Manager for CEMEX Rail Solutions, sees health and safety as the No.1 priority and an ongoing process of continuous improvement: \u201cWe are always looking for ways we can improve the site and keep staff working safely.  I put forward the idea of a CCTV system as a means of maintaining site safety.  We could also use it for security as we have our own rail sidings, but this was not the main reason.  We discussed it and thought it was a good idea. \u201cStanley supplies our Time and Attendance equipment\u201d explains Terry \u201cand I mentioned the issues we were having with the CCTV company by chance and they offered their services, which was great.  They did a very good job.  The system is very professional.\u201d STANLEY recommended a 16 camera IP HD CCTV system, capable of providing high definition observation.  A range of external and internal cameras have been installed in strategic positions across the site with all images fed back for monitoring and recording onto a sophisticated network video recorder.  The system runs over CEMEX\u2019s existing IP network, providing considerable cost savings on cabling required for traditional CCTV systems, whilst maintaining quality.  Due to the nature of the site, the entire CCTV system was installed out of hours over three weekends with STANLEY staff working to very strict health and safety criteria.　<\/p>\n<p>CEMEX  is impressed with the finished CCTV system and the way in which the installation was carried out.  \u201cOver several visits to our site, Stanley\u2019s team adhered to all Health and Safety procedures, including the use and operation of the site\u2019s mobile elevated platform\u201d states Terry.  \u201cThe conduct of the team was excellent, and works were completed in a timely manner.  We are very pleased with the CCTV system.\u201d The installation has proven so successful that CEMEX has expanded the system by adding a further eight cameras.<\/p>"

It is known locally for high quality aggregates and ready mix concrete which is delivered across the region.

He says: <em>\u201cMy first involvement with PRIME was back in 2015 and I immediately knew that this was a standard this site could and would achieve. It has  the associated professional benefits of being recognised for what we do, as well as the joint kudos for everyone involved at Pallett Hill, as achieving PRIME is a true team effort.\u201d<\/em> <\/p><p>PRIME is the driving force behind the introduction of the new Technical Member (TMIQ) grade.

Mike commented: <em>\u201cIt was great to spend time at Pallett Hill and it brought back many happy memories. Having visited and toured this site I can see a real change. The continued improvements are really noticeable and I hope the further work into the future carries on. The introduction of a quarry vegetable patch was one of many innovative ideas where managers, supervisors and operatives can truly work together and glean true value from their time at work.

I know that we are one of the first within CEMEX to achieve this accolade, and hope that many sites will follow in our footsteps. This process has led to improvement not only for myself and my team, but for the site as a whole. We all understand the value of increased morale and engagement, and the celebration of this achievement, along with the friendly competition it will engender is a positive influence for all.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

The strategy involved a challenging audit process and complete change of culture amongst our employees,\u201d commented Andy Spencer, Director of Sustainability and Energy. Once each site had been audited and the results analysed, the right bins and skips for the right waste to minimise landfill and maximise recycling were put in place. With the right facilities on each site, a campaign highlighting environmental and financial benefits for better waste management was implemented to engage employees. Andy concludes: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have achieved it without the commitment of everyone in CEMEX UK.  They have really embraced the whole initiative.  It is now everyday practice for them to recycle and divert waste from landfill. Before Recycle R8 we had 27% waste diverted away from landfill today it is 80%, with us moving towards our 100% target.\u201d<\/p> <p> <\/p>"

This is what they did: Having previously organised Driver Health & Safety Meetings in groups of 10+ Hazelcroft Garage recognised that the format was not working, and due to the large numbers attending, drivers were reluctant to open up and discuss any issues. <\/p>  <p>In 2016 Hazelcroft Garage introduced their Driver Health & Safety forums which take place in groups of four. The meetings start with a review of the Minutes from the last meeting before reviewing Safety Alerts, Near Miss Hazard Alert Forms and completing any new Near Miss Hazard Alert Forms for any issues raised during the meeting. <\/p><p>Minutes are taken and reviewed at every meeting ensuring that all concerns and issues are recorded and drivers can be kept updated on progress. Hazelcroft Garage now feel that a positive health & safety culture is now being embraced rather than becoming a \u2018tick box\u2019 exercise. <\/p><p>The picture is of Ronnie Simpson (left) presenting the certificate to Ian Tomlinson (owner of Hazelcroft Garage, right), and the red letter prize to Driver, Nigel Clark (centre).<\/p>"

      "Body": "<p>A little over 12 months ago CEMEX Rail Solutions were asked by London Underground  for a design of concrete bearer for curves of less than 200m radius.  <\/p><p>The particular issue with tight curves is that of wheel / rail alignment around the curve. The way to ensure that wheels remain on the track is by use of a check rail next to the running rail; this guides the wheel and keeps it on the rail. <\/p><p>London Underground had designs of 2 base plates, one for the check rail end and one for the running rail on the other end of the bearer but needed to mount it on a concrete bearer. This was not straight forward as there were 2 complications highlighted by a Finite Element Analysis carried out by Durham University.<\/p>  <p>The method of attaching the base plate to the bearer was via a cast in plastic dowell. This is a known crack inducer in pre-stressed concrete due to tensile forcesset up around the dowell. The dowells on one end need to be in close proximity to mounting positions for 3rd and 4th conductor rail mounting positions. <\/p><p>These conductor rails are bolted on again into a plastic insert (another crack inducer). To overcome these issues we have adopted industry practice from Germany and placed a tight fitting helical reinforcement around the plastic dowells to contain cracks. <\/p><p>The plastic inserts for conductor rail mounting have been replaced by metal inserts.  A second finite element analysis by Durham University concluded that these changes had significantly reduced the risk of crack propogation within the unit.  A further 2 variants of check rail bearer were designed (short ended at either end) at the same time to allow for drainage catch pits which are sometimes in the way trackside.<\/p>  <p>Thanks to the contribution of our Operations, Maintenance and Quality Departments the 3 variants went into full production of around 100 units per week at Somercotes in early April and our client is forecasting a positive future demand by end of the year.   <\/p><p>A further variant is now being looked at to incorporate standard pandrol fastclip fastenings and inclined concrete; this would be used where the client has noise and vibration issues where a soft undersleeper pad could be used.<\/p>"

There is a large winter gull roost which can hold as many as 28000 birds.  Passing birds of prey include the majestic osprey, whilst buzzard and sparrowhawk can be seen regularly.   Almost any migrant bird can turn up - black tern are regulars but species like little egret and the more uncommon waders are also seen.     <\/p><p>Lackford Lakes has a thriving visitor centre with regular activities ranging from bird watching courses, to art exhibitions, to family activity days.  The reserve is free to visit and open year round.  Suffolk Wildlife Trust is the county\u2019s leading environmental charity and is supported by more than 26,000 members \u2013 joining the Trust is the best way to show your support for their conservation activities.  Find out more at: <\/p> <p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/lackfordlakes\">http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/lackfordlakes<\/a><\/p> <p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lackford-Lakes-Suffolk-Wildlife-Trust/129367447183011\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lackford-Lakes-Suffolk-Wildlife-Trust/129367447183011<\/a><\/p>Lackford Lakes is well worth a visit year round, but the months of November and December are particularly special as both the gull and starling roosts build in numbers as the sun goes down."

The renovation project required a mass filling of the existing basement with 20N/mm2 concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>When contractor, Paul John construction approached CEMEX for a suitable voidfill solution, we proposed to use Porofoam, our low density foamed concrete. Using Porofoam enabled the pour to be completed in less than half the time than standard concrete. Due to it\u2019s reduced plastic density Porofoam could be placed in much thicker layers reducing lateral pressures exerted on the 165 year old internal walls of the basement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Porofoam is also self-compacting and self-levelling, which made it much easier for the contractor to place in the network of basement chambers. Porofoam is available in a range of densities and strengths and is manufactured using our proprietary CEMEX admixtures. For this project CEMEX delivered around 60m3 of pre-mixed Porofoam over 2 days to fill the void which achieved the required 20N/mm2 concrete strength.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/porofoam-lightweight-foamed-concrete-for-voidfill.aspx\" style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#b23035; color:#ffffff; font-weight:bold; float:right;\">Foamed Concrete<\/a><\/p>"

      "Body": "<p>Birds, bees and hedgehogs need all the help they can get from us. Winter can be a tough time for Britain\u2019s wildlife.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the nights draw in and temperatures drop, native animals like hedgehogs need to find a safe, cosy spot to hibernate until spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Food sources can also be scarce for our butterflies, birds and bees. Turning your garden into a sanctuary for woodland wildlife in autumn can make all the difference to our native species\u2019 survival.<\/p>\n\n<p>That doesn\u2019t have to mean pricey garden centre buys or hours of work. Something as simple as filling up your bird feeder, leaving your compost heap to nature or adding a few late-flowering plants will attract more animals and ensure your new guests are safe, fed and watered until the cold months have passed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the RSPB\u2019s top winter tips:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Don\u2019t be so tidy! Leave an area of your garden unkempt for wildlife to live in.<\/li>\n\t<li>Build a hedgehog house. Woodpiles are great for our spiky friends to live in and hunt for insects.<\/li>\n\t<li>Buy a bird box and give birds somewhere to shelter in the winter.<\/li>\n\t<li>Keep your pond uncovered as it will remain a crucial spot for birds to drink and find bugs and insects to eat.<\/li>\n\t<li>Top up your bird bath so birds can stay clean and keep it ice free. Putting a table tennis ball in will help as the breeze will move it and keep the bath free from ice.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add a hedge! These are great for privacy and wildlife. Evergreen hedges such as holly \u2018Handsworth New Silver\u2019 and Firethorn \u2018Teton\u2019 (Pyracantha) not only provide year-round colour but their berries provide winter food for garden birds.<\/li>\n\t<li>Make fences hedgehog friendly. If hedging isn\u2019t an option for your garden, you can create a five inch hole in the bottom of your fence or gate so that hedgehogs and other wildlife can crawl in and out.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add late flowering plants. Nectar and pollen tend to be in short supply during this time, but they are still essential foods for many insects \u2013 such as Michaelmas daisies, sedums, ivy and asters. Also, include some native trees and shrubs in your garden such as rowan, holly, guelder rose, wild rose, blackthorn or hawthorn.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add a butterfly box so insects can sleep soundly over the colder months.<\/li>\n\t<li>Fill your birdfeeder with high energy foods. Fat balls and cakes are great it\u2019s best to get the hanging feeders or enclosed ones so that the grey squirrels don\u2019t get it all!<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

Inspired by a visit to a landmark property in Mexico designed by architects Reyes Rios + Larrain Studio and supplied by CEMEX, the idea for Concrete House was shaped by the henequen hacienda style and the intelligent fabric-first design principles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concrete House was designed by Graeme Laughlin of the award-winning practice RAW Architecture Workshop. His design gives Adrian, his wife Megan and their three children a functional yet stylish house, laid out in clearly defined \u2018wings\u2019 which spur off from the central kitchen and living areas. Each area of the house sits at a slightly different level, giving a greater sense of individuality and separation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The over-riding design principles for the house were energy efficiency and use of disruptive methodologies. Adrian\u2019s vision to create a high performing house for his family was equally matched by his willingness to challenge the accepted norms of house building in the UK, and perhaps even discover a way to revolutionise the way we think about building.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX provided early stage materials advice to Adrian and his design team to help to realise some of these goals. From the start it was clear that concrete was to be the primary material, but aside from structure, what other functions could concrete take on?<\/p>\n\n<p>Working closely with the CEMEX Research Group in Switzerland, a range of innovative concrete solutions were proposed to Adrian and Graeme during a 2 day workshop. During this time, key principles of thermal and structural design were defined alongside an intensive materials selection process.<\/p>\n\n<p>The design of the structure was centred around cast-in-situ \u2018sandwich panels\u2019, comprising 2 leaves of concrete with a central core of insulating material. This method of solid wall construction has a number of clear advantages including superior air-tightness and significantly reduced thermal conductivity values.<\/p>\n\n<p>Building in this way usually requires <span style=\"color:black\">tons<\/span> of steel reinforcement, cranes to lift formwork <span style=\"color:black\">which<\/span> can take up valuable program time. In order to counter this, CEMEX proposed the use of its <b>Resilia HP<\/b> Fibre-Reinforced Self Compacting Concrete for the structural walls and horizontal elements. Selecting a high-performance fibre-reinforced concrete allowed Adrian\u2019s design team to significantly reduce the amount of steel reinforcement, up to 60% less than in the original design. <b>Resilia HP<\/b> &nbsp;is not only a high strength product, it is also highly ductile, allowing for thinner sections to be cast. This design choice also had an added benefit in speeding up the cycle time between casting of the walls, as there was very little steel to detail and fix. Being a self-compacting concrete (SCC) also meant that the material could be placed into the forms with minimal intervention from the contractor, allowing them to pour each element quicker and more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is widely accepted that concrete performs equally as well as a thermal envelope, providing a great natural method of keeping houses at an even temperature, regardless of the external temperature. But even the most efficient houses can suffer from heat loss at key structural junctions. Following a thorough thermal modelling process assisted by CEMEX Research Group, some key areas of the structure were identified as being prone to heat loss, particularly where horizontal and vertical elements meet. The use of another advanced concrete was proposed to mitigate this. <b>Insularis<\/b>,<b> <\/b>a lightweight concrete, was developed by CEMEX to provide a thermal break in concrete structures. With a much lower thermal conductivity value than traditional concretes, Insularis gives designers the option of continuing the concrete through the junction without compromising on strength or adding in other materials. For Concrete House, <b>Insularis<\/b> was used to form the kickers at the base of the external walls, dealing with the heat loss issues and helping Adrian\u2019s vision of an energy efficient build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Speed and efficiency were also a huge part of the build, and to support this Adrian formed a partnership with Peri UK to use their new Duo® lightweight formwork system. Duo can be assembled by hand in much quicker times, due to its plastic composition and low overall weight. Traditional formworks often require a crane to lift each section into place, an expense not associate with the average self-build project. CEMEX worked closely with Peri and Adrian\u2019s design team to make sure that the <b>Resilia <span style=\"color:black\">HP<\/span> <\/b>concrete would perform well in conjunction with the Duo system. Early site trials were conducted using both brand new products, which allowed CEMEX to optimise the mix design and also improve the production process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Work began on site in September 2017, the site being levelled and foundations being prepared. CEMEX supplied 109m3 of traditional GEN3 concrete for what was probably the most straightforward part of the concrete works. In early November the work to the suspended slabs began in earnest. With a high water table and potential for clay heave, Adrian was forced to adopt additional measures to protect the ground slab, which included a level of steel reinforcement. For this element CEMEX designed the <b>&nbsp;Resilia Conventional<\/b> mix, taking account of the presence of the steel reinforcement and the reduced need for the concrete to perform to a higher flexural strength value. Around 120m3 of <b>Resilia Conventional<\/b> was supplied to form the ground slabs and upstands between level changes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Into December and the first walls were ready to be poured. Due to the layout of the building, Adrian and his build team had to carefully select the build route around the site to avoid conflict between the formwork supports. Smaller sections of walls at low lying parts of the building were completed first, in a methodical sequence which then dictated the speed of build. As the build team became more accustomed to the <b>Resilia HP<\/b>, they were able to place lager volumes per pour.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pouring the walls was not without its share of drama, with the supplying plant being located much further from the project than usually done. This distance caused some early stage issues with logistics and this was made clear when one CEMEX vehicle suffered a puncture whilst travelling to site. The resultant delay in getting the material to site caused a pour line along an external courtyard wall. Fortunately, the <b>Resilia HP<\/b> was designed with four hours of consistence retention, so the material was able to be placed after the short delay with only an aesthetic line on the courtyard wall. Following on from this CEMEX changed the timing and method of production at the plant, allowing more loads to leave for site earlier in the morning to beat the morning rush hour.<\/p>\n\n<p>In January 2018 the first requirement for <b>Insularis<\/b> came around, another first for CEMEX UK to produce. Following trials with assistance from CEMEX Research Group, we prepared to pour the first set of kickers. The first attempt at pumping the material ran into issues, where the concrete would not immediately pump. The decision was taken to hand place the material due to the time limits in place. CEMEX went away and made some modifications to the mix for the second attempt some days later. Again, initially the material blocked the pump, but with some adjustments to the pump configuration the material finally flowed into place. Variations in the raw material alongside the configuration of the pump had caused the issues, but working together with the site team these were overcome.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final structural elements were the roof slabs, where again the levels rose and fell across the building. More upstands and parapets were cast in an intricate sequence of pours planned by Adrian and his team.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once structurally complete there was one more element that required assistance from CEMEX. The final floor construction called for underfloor heating pipes to be laid, with a finished concrete or screed floor. Working with Adrian again, CEMEX proposed a number of options including screeds, but finally it was another concrete which fit the bill. A bespoke version of our <b>Evolution<\/b> Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) was designed to allow a finished concrete surface, without compromising on the floor levels throughout the build and also allowing for a powerfloated finish. The mix, called <b>Evolution F <\/b>contained a range of CEMEX Admixtures which were added to aid the placement of the material whilst controlling the consistence retention to give the contractor time to work with the material.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the completion of the project CEMEX had supplied 4 brand new mix designs all developed and modified to suit the project, with the ongoing assistance of the CEMEX Research Group, the wider CEMEX UK business and related supply chain partners. The project has served as a platform for development of not only new variations of mixes but also the range of applications and sectors which could benefit from utilising these new advances in concrete technology.<\/p>"

The current contract is to be extended for a further 12 months.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of the electricity supplied to the sites will be from 100% renewable energy sources including wind energy. As these sources produce zero carbon emissions, this makes a significant contribution to reducing CEMEX UK\u2019s carbon footprint. ENGIE\u2019s renewable electricity supply is underpinned by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs).<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE and CEMEX UK\u2019s commitment to renewable electricity is therefore making a positive contribution to the decarbonisation of energy in the UK.

The first truck of its type was on display at the 2019 Concrete Show.<\/p>\n\n<p>The latest innovations focus not only on driver safety but that of vulnerable road users and have been engineered to address the principal concerns of today\u2019s Readymix concrete industry including accidents with falls from height &nbsp;and slips, trips and falls. &nbsp;Other innovations are designed to help reduce the environmental impact.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the new systems reduces emissions by managing the drum speed and engine condition during travelling and at the site. It is possible to make a saving of up to 90% whilst waiting to deliver on site. After delivery the Hymix system provides for self-sufficient wash down and has also introduced a method of neutralizing the pH of the wash water making it harmless and safe to dispose of into the waste water system.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the driver these new developments will reduce their workload allowing them to concentrate on safe driving. Additional safety features help reduce the frequency of rollovers and unplanned incidents whilst the Hymix site light system (SLS) has been extended to improve visibility further in low light conditions and when maneuvering in tight spaces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>James Harper, General Manager at Hymix, said: \u201cImproving safety and helping reduce both serious and minor accidents is a high priority in our vehicle development programme and we aim to work with the industry and key stakeholders to ensure the safety of all involved &nbsp;Our roads are getting busier and potential for danger is greater than ever, it is for everyone in the supply chain to contribute in mitigating risks to all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Charlie Stanford \u2013 National Fleet Liaison Manager at Cemex UK said \u201cWe will one of the first in the industry to take a truck with the new features.

      "Body": "<p>The Port of London Authority (PLA) is investing in the new conveyor and infrastructure as part of their Investment Plan. The development will enable CEMEX Marine dredgers to discharge sand and gravel more efficiently for processing at the Northfleet site.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Marine dredgers bring sand and gravel from the North Sea and other off-shore locations into three wharves along the Thames including Northfleet, primarily for use in the London construction market. The site currently handles approximately 500,000 tonnes of material a year, which will increase to approximately 800,000 \u2013 850,000 tonnes with the system due to the faster turn round of vessels.<\/p>\n\n<p>The PLA\u2019s Investment Plan is principally aimed at delivering the goals of the Thames Vision, which targets greater river use, alongside an improving environment. The Plan\u2019s goals are to sustain or increase port trade/river use and generate commercial returns.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur investment at Northfleet is the first under the Investment Plan and is a perfect example of what we are looking to achieve,\u201d explained PLA chief executive, Robin Mortimer. \u201cWe are financing the improved discharge systems that will marry up well with the new dredger that CEMEX has on order. In combination this will secure the long term future of cargo handling at this key site and generate a commercial return which we can re-invest in other river projects.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Marine Director, Kurt Cowdrey comments \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to partner with the PLA to improve cargo handling on the Thames. London is an important market for us and this investment will provide a platform for continued use and future growth at Northfleet.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe capital needs approximately 10 million tonnes* of sand, gravel and crushed rock every year to build, maintain and improve housing, buildings and infrastructure. The use of water to transport building materials to the heart of the city reduces the need for long distance lorry movements, with every dredger reducing the need for 250 lorries on our busy roads.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The new dry discharge system will be completed mid to end June 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\u2013 ends \u2013<\/p>"

This year as part of the Earth Day celebrations, CEMEX Europe colleagues specializing in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) will be holding workshops for school children at schools near CEMEX operations. The theme of the workshops will be to support one of the main Earth Day\u2019s principles, to help end plastic pollution.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is expected that the workshops will increase the environmental awareness of this significant topic by encouraging pupils to learn about recycling and upcycling as a method of transforming plastic waste into usable objects.<\/p>\n\n<p>2.5 billion tons of waste are generated in EU countries every year, according to the European Commission. The key reasons for this waste are the result of excessive consumption, over production and ill-informed buying habits without consideration of the longevity and durability of products.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is committed to minimizing the impact of its operations on the environment and to ensure it is the best possible neighbor in the communities in which it operates. Izabella Rokicka Communications and CSR Director, CEMEX Europe comments \u201cAs a company we develop products and building solution to build more sustainable construction and infrastructure which communities need. At the same time, we aim to work with those communities to provide solutions that improve the quality of life for all.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis project aims to educate young people in a fun and innovative way about waste and how they can help tackle some of the environmental issues that we face. Hopefully it will encourage them to challenge the throw-away culture, as well as reduce the amount of waste that is generated going forward. This is the first pan-European activity and it\u2019s a great start to future projects.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The workshops will be held throughout 2019 in the seven European countries where the company operates: UK, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and Croatia. The workshops will be organized in cooperation with local schools, and run jointly with local social partners specializing in recycling and upcycling.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services to customers and communities in more than 50 countries.

Consequently, energy storage solutions that can harness energy from renewable sources become vital if cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy are sought.<\/li>\n\t<li>In the absence of longer duration and more cost-effective energy storage, the amount of electricity that can be delivered to the grid from renewable energy sources, even though now widely affordable, has been limited.<\/li>\n\t<li>For the first time, Energy Vault\u2019s system enables renewables to deliver baseload power below the cost of fossil fuels 24 hours a day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This investment follows a previously announced technology partnership with CEMEX to provide concrete and other composite material technology for Energy Vault\u2019s storage towers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Energy Vault\u2019s breakthrough technology was inspired by pumped hydro plants that rely on the power of gravity and the movement of water to store and discharge electricity. This solution is based on the same well-understood principles of physics and mechanical engineering used in those plants. Energy Vault\u2019s system replaces water with custom made concrete bricks through an innovative use of low-cost materials. The massive bricks are combined with its patented system design and proprietary algorithm-based software to operate a newly designed crane. The crane orchestrates the energy storage tower and electricity charge/discharge while accounting for a variety of factors, including energy supply and demand volatility, weather elements and other variables such as inertia and system deflection.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result, Energy Vault can deliver all the benefits of a gravity-based pumped hydro system with lower price, higher round trip efficiency, without the requirement for specific land topographies and negative environmental or wildlife impacts. Importantly, with Energy Vault\u2019s longer duration and more cost-effective energy storage, electricity from renewables can be delivered for less than the price of fossil fuels 24 hours a day for the first time. In April 2019, Energy Vault won the World Changing Idea Award from Fast Company in the Energy category for the unprecedented economic and environmental benefits its technology provides.<\/p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cEnergy storage that enables power to be delivered for less than the cost of fossil fuels is critical as the world shifts away from its reliance on carbon-based fuels to renewable energy,\u201d<\/i> said Gonzalo Galindo, CEO of CEMEX Ventures. <i>\u201cEnergy Vault\u2019s storage technology is transformational, and we\u2019re extremely pleased to broaden our relationship and support the company\u2019s efforts.

The name was unveiled at the event by record producer and rail enthusiast Pete Waterman. Resplendent in the white, blue and red colours of the CEMEX brand, the vehicle recognises the partnership between GBRf and CEMEX, which has now been in place for one year.<br />\nThe Cemex Express, a Class 66 Locomotive, will travel typically between Dove Holes quarry, carrying premium aggregate for our readymix and asphalt plants, and external customers throughout the UK. It will pull 22 to 26 hopper wagons that discharge their loads from underneath directly onto the plant\u2019s conveyors. A single trainload can deliver up to 2,000 tons of material in one trip and will make over 200 trips for CEMEX each year; the equivalent of over 20,000 truckloads.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nDavid Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK &amp; France, commented: \u201cThe transport of our product by rail is of ever-increasing importance to CEMEX as we look to make our operations as sustainable as possible. Rail is a far more environmentally friendly method of transport than trucks on the road, as a train burns significantly less fuel per ton-mile than road vehicles, saving around 50% in CO2 emissions.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX UK currently transports 2.6 million tonnes of aggregate by rail each year which equates to approximately 100,000 trucks off the road; enough to build 40,000 houses; and we want to continue to build on this. We are very proud of our partnership with GBRf and hope that together we will be able to transport more and more by rail safely whilst reducing the number of truck movements.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nLex Russell, Managing Director for UK Materials North at CEMEX, added: \u201cDove Holes is one of CEMEX\u2019s most important quarries and generates several million tonnes of limestone aggregates every year, as well as asphalt, readymix, concrete products and dry silo mortar. &nbsp;By rail we then supply many locations across the UK including key cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham and London.<br />\n\u201cIt was therefore the perfect location to unveil The Cemex Express locomotive and take the opportunity to thank those in our team and at GBRf for their hard work and dedication to our rail partnership.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nJohn Smith, Managing Director of GBRf, said \u201cWe are delighted to unveil this fantastic Class 60 locomotive, painted in the CEMEX livery and representing our two organisations\u2019 ongoing partnership. This contract is demonstrative of the role rail freight has to play in helping the UK to cut carbon emissions and to improve air quality.&nbsp;<br />\nOn average, one gallon of fuel will move one tonne of goods 246 miles on the rail network, while the same amount will only get you 88 miles by road. Rail freight\u2019s CO2 emissions are 76 per cent lower than road\u2019s, per tonne carried. An average freight train removes 60 HGV journeys from the roads and the largest up to 160. When this is combined with rail\u2019s advantageous performance in terms of nitrous oxide and particulate matter emissions, rail freight demonstrates a clear contribution to the challenge of meeting the UK\u2019s carbon-cutting targets.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:&nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

      "Body": "<p>The club was looking for a sand which could increase the grip for horses while on the pitch, enhancing performance, and offer better drainage. The sand needed to allow horses to run safely and comfortably during damp conditions, helping their hooves to grip to the grass. It was also important for the sand to feature a good particle size distribution and bury itself into the grass.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nIn addition to the 3,000 tonnes initially provided, a further 2,500 tonnes will be provided to the club before the end of the year, with the same total quantity required annually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nneogem\u2019s sports sand pro was identified as the best sand to meet the club\u2019s needs. This high-quality sand has been certified, tested and approved by the Sports Turf Research Institute (STRI). It is washed prior to delivery to ensure a fine, soft finish.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nTracey Taylor, neogem sales representative, commented: \u201cIt was a real privilege to work with Cowdray Park Polo Club as they prepare for this year\u2019s Gold Cup. neogem\u2019s sport sand is the ideal product for such a world-class polo pitch; helping the horses to perform and the pitch to retain its reputation as an incomparable setting for a premier polo tournament.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n\u201cOne of the key challenges for this project is to work around the British weather; sand can only be spread when it is dry and not too windy. This meant a close working relationship was needed with the club to ensure we could supply at short notice and can also continue to do so throughout the season as repairs and top-ups to the pitches are needed.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nJulian Russell Hayes, Grounds Manager at Cowdray Park Polo Club, added: \u201cWe need our polo pitch to be at its best for the Gold Cup and choosing the right sports sand is a key part of this. We are very happy with the neogem product and the service provided during purchase, delivery and installation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe premium aggregates available from neogem are now available in selected countries across Europe, and are fast building a reputation as luxury, high performance products that can be relied upon, particularly in the sports sector.

The inclusion of a central mixer also enables special products such as traditional sand cement screed and flowing screeds like Supaflo to be produced, increasing the product range available.&nbsp;<br />\nAs the plant is sited directly in the quarry, it means materials will no longer have to be transported from the Bramshill to Eversley by truck, dramatically decreasing the number of trucks on local roads and offering substantial eco advantages.

This new ship represents a significant investment and the first new vessel both in the CEMEX fleet and that of the UK aggregate industry in over 20 years. Today we convert a lot of hard work, technical drawings, calculations, ideas, energetic discussions and exchange of point-of-views, into a physical floating object, by the highly skilled women and men of Galati and Mangalia.\u201d<br />\nThe CEMEX Go Innovation is the first of Damen\u2019s new Marine Aggregate Dredger class, a 103.5 metre MAD 3500. The vessel is the result of close cooperation between CEMEX and Damen and represents the first of a new generation of efficient and economical dredgers specialising in the extraction of sand and gravel from the seabed. It is designed to extract aggregates from the sea bed up to depths of 55 metres, including in the challenging conditions experienced in the North Sea.&nbsp;<br />\nThe CEMEX Go Innovation has been developed to offer major environmental savings while ensuring safety, high performance and sustainability. The result is a dredger which will have a 25% increased capacity, nearly double the dredging depth and discharge rate increase of 20%. Further design features include optimal balance between payload and efficiency, overall length of 103.5 metres, a deadweight of just under 7,000 tonnes and a maximum loaded speed of approximately 12 knots.<br />\nFollowing its launch, the CEMEX Go Innovation will complete its fitting out with commissioning due to begin at the end of the year, and delivery expected in the early spring of 2020.<br />\nLaurence Dagley, managing director, CEMEX Materials UK Southern, commented: \u201cIt was very exciting to see our state-of-the-art dredger, CEMEX Go Innovation, and participate in the traditional launch ceremony with Damen. This is a ground-breaking ship that leads the industry thanks to the major environmental savings that it offers, its increased capacity and dredging depth, and its safety-enhancing external pipework. We look forward to the CEMEX Go Innovation arriving in the UK and beginning its work early next year.\u201d<br />\nKurt Cowdery, director of CEMEX Marine, added: \u201cCEMEX GO Innovation is a state-of-the-art vessel that will allow us to further enhance our Marine profile and capability in both the UK and Europe. &nbsp;We continue to stay ahead of our competitors and are maximising the opportunities available to us. We would like to thank all that have been involved with this project, in particular the Marine team. This is an excellent investment in our people, business and future!\u201d<br />\n\u201cThe cooperation between Damen and CEMEX UK Marine has been really excellent,\u201d said Damen\u2019s Joppe Neijens, sales manager dredging for north, west and south Europe. \u201cIt has been a very smooth process and we have built the vessel together, using the original Damen MAD concept as the basis for a vessel optimised to meet the needs of CEMEX. They challenged us to meet their requirements and as a joint team we made it happen. This new dredger will differentiate itself from the current fleet and set a new standard in the industry.

From the original three remaining Small Blue colonies which were all under threat, the number of colonies has now grown to 23, many of the colonies on CEMEX or former CEMEX sites. Warwickshire now has more colonies recorded than ever before. &nbsp;The work in Warwickshire has also helped conserve other rare butterflies including the Grizzled and Dingy Skippers, Dark Green Fritillary and Chalk Carpet Moth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Newly found<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Northumberland RSPB and CEMEX are working together at Divethill quarry preserving and creating the rare habitat called Whin grassland. &nbsp;During 2019 the Small Pearl-Bordered Fritillary was found on site. This was good news as the species is an important pollinator for the wildflower assemblage found in the grassland. Future restoration at the site will increase the area of rare grassland and include the addition of important native woodland fringes. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandgate quarry, Blue Adonis \u2013 The Blue Adonis is one of the UK\u2019s rarest butterflies and is found in only a few colonies doted along the south east coast. The butterfly has very specific requirements for its habitat including well cropped grass on a south facing meadow. &nbsp;The meadow also needs to support the butterfly\u2019s host plant which is Horseshoe Vetch. &nbsp;As part of the restoration work at Sandgate a habitat has been created that perfectly matches these requirements. With a colony already established at the nearby Cissbury Ring we have been lucky enough to attract this rare species to our site. During May 2019, a healthy population was discovered on site. Key measures going forward are to preserve the habitat and ensure the colony is protected. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopeful colonisers<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Raynes quarry in Wales is adjacent to Mynydd Marian SSSI which is home to a rare colony of Silver Studded Blue. RSPB and CEMEX have implemented a Biodiversity Action Plan to focus restoration work on habitat creation to improve the site for a bird species called the Chough, Wildflowers and the Silver-studded Blue butterfly. The quarry is developing a habitat called Calcareous grassland on restored areas of the site. This work has been ongoing for a number of years and utilised hay from the SSSI as a source of grass and wildflower seeds. The butterfly\u2019s main food plant is Common Rock Rose, which is now found on site. &nbsp;Surveys are carried out annually. &nbsp;To date, 2019 has shown that there are over 80 species flowering plant found in the grassland which already supports large and abundant butterfly populations. Some of the species found at the quarry this year included the Small White, Gatekeeper, Ringlet, Small Heath and also the Shaded Broad Bar Moth. The focus now is to encourage the Silver Studded Blue to site. The Chough continues to use the site for nesting and rearing its young during the summer months. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ancient woodland that flanks CEMEX Newbridge quarry in North Yorkshire is rich in Flora and Fauna and it is also home to the most northerly population of Duke of Burgundy, a tiny pretty butterfly whose food plant, Cowslip, grows in the areas of open woodland. Restoration has encouraged Cowslips to colonise the grassland-wood fringe and we are hopeful the Duke of Burgundy will follow soon.<\/p>"

The facility in Tilbury currently has approximately 2,800 employees but is set to increase to over 4,000. The Amazon KIVA robots are in operation at the facility and it was a joy to see how the robot was used. It was also interesting to hear that the robots were not a direct replacement for people but actually have created a requirement to employ more due to the efficiency of the robots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some key principles of the robot use were to improve storage effectiveness with a greater utilisation of floor space; by using the KIVA robot Amazon were able to store 40% more inventory. The CEMEX team were very interested to see how the health and safety was part of the robotic innovation. It was obvious that manual movements had been removed from this area of the process, eliminating all the risk associated with manual handling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Isolation was remarkably a lot more high-tech, the need for engineers to have access to the area where the robots were moving was essential due to the size of the facility. All engineering staff that required access, of which only two were trained per floor per shift, are issued a special type of vest which has an imbedded sensor, this sensor is picked up by any KIVA robot within five metres of the engineer and will immediately stop, once the engineer moves the KIVA robot will commence on its planned route.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Terence Clair, Operations Manager for Rail Solutions UK, said: \u201cIt was good to discuss some of the challenges faced around health and safety, with peoples\u2019 behaviours being a top topic for them much like ourselves.

In addition, the driver can control the process by remote control from inside the cab \u2013 further increasing safety and minimising potential risk.<br />\nUsing these trailers also ensures a steady flow of clay from the truck into the reception hopper, reducing stress on the reception hopper and feeder. The belt trailer is also proven to discharge a load in the same amount of time as traditional tipper trucks.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, air vents in the trailer prevent the clay from sweating, while the stainless-steel body ensures a clean discharge of material, without any clay sticking.&nbsp;<br />\nBMD Transport, who were awarded a five-year contract with CEMEX to haul clay, has initially purchased two trucks from Fruehauf with plans to acquire an additional seven over the next year and replace the whole existing fleet for this route with the new models.&nbsp;<br />\nWhen the whole fleet has changed to these vehicles, there are further potential benefits; it could reduce the time to discharge each load, as drivers will not have to wait for the preceding load to have cleared the reception hopper before they start to deliver their load. This could then mean that CEMEX can increase the amount of clay brought from Southam each day.<br />\nLee Needham, Inbound Manager for UK Cement Operations at CEMEX, commented: \u201cWhen BMD presented these new trucks to us, we knew they would be a very positive addition to our fleet. Ensuring the safety of those who work for us and on our sites is of vital importance to CEMEX, and we are always looking for ways to improve our operation. These vehicles offer a very obvious safety benefit and meet FORS Silver standard, plus are also efficient and reliable. We look forward to working with BMD to replace the remainder of the fleet.\u201d<br />\nDec Chokar, Director at BMD Transport, added: \u201cThese new trucks are state of the art and have been specifically designed to be used for transporting clay.

      "Body": "<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first lorry safety scheme of its kind launches in London this week<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Direct Vision Standard seeks to eliminate dangerous Heavy Goods Vehicle blind spots, proven to be the cause of pedestrian and cyclist deaths and serious injuries<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HGVs that fail to meet new minimum safety standards will be issued a penalty charge for driving in the capital.<br />\nSadiq visited CEMEX\u2019s Stepney Concrete Plant today to see DVS lorries in action. All of the vehicles that CEMEX operates in London meet or exceed the minimum DVS requirements in place until 2024.<br />\n&nbsp;The first of its kind, the Direct Vision Standard tackles road danger at its source by minimising HGV blind spots which contribute to many tragic deaths and life-changing injuries. Based on how much a driver can see directly through their cab windows, the &nbsp;unique star system rates HGVs over 12 tonnes from zero (lowest) to five (highest). HGVs will need to meet a minimum \u2018one-star\u2019 rating by the time enforcement begins to enable them to operate in London, or will need to fit \u2018Safe System\u2019 measures to improve the vehicle\u2019s safety.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;Big lorries are disproportionately involved in fatal collisions. Whilst they account for just four per cent of the overall miles driven in the capital, between 2015 and 2017, HGVs were involved in 63 per cent of fatal collisions involving cyclists and 25 per cent involving pedestrians.<br />\n&nbsp;From this week, operators can apply for a HGV Safety Permit ahead of enforcement beginning on 26 October 2020. HGV operators who fail to meet these new minimum safety standards and obtain a permit will be issued a penalty charge for driving in the capital. The Direct Vision Standard will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will be enforced within the Greater London Boundary.&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:<\/strong> \u201cI\u2019m proud of our world-leading plans to remove the most dangerous lorries from London\u2019s streets. So many of the tragic deaths on our roads involve HGVs and this new scheme will help save lives.<br />\n\u201cForward-looking businesses have already been choosing safer vehicles in the run up to HGV safety permits becoming available. Today the scheme has gone live and operators now have 12 months to upgrade their fleets, helping make our streets much safer for people walking and cycling.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>David Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK, commented:<\/strong> \u201cWe were honoured to welcome Sadiq Khan and the TfL team to our Stepney site today, as the Direct Vision Standard is launched. DVS is a landmark scheme that will ensure that all road users and pedestrians are safe as they come across HGVs while moving around the city. We fully support the programme; safety is CEMEX\u2019s number one priority and informs all aspects of our operation.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are committed to investing in, and developing, our fleet so that it continues to reflect the latest advancements in safety features. In the UK, we are proud to be a FORS Gold operator and compliant with the CLOCS standard, and are just as committed to the Direct Vision Standard for HGVs. We look forward to continuing to work with the Mayor, TfL and London councils for safer roads and streets here in London and beyond.\u201d<br />\nOwners of vehicles rated zero-star will need to improve the overall safety of their vehicle by fitting a \u2018Safe System\u2019 to reduce the risk it presents to people walking, cycling and riding motorcycles before enforcement begins. These include a camera monitoring system, a noise alert when turning left and sensors. Fitting the \u2018Safe System\u2019 will not improve a vehicle's DVS star rating but will bring the safety standard of the vehicle up to allow operators to apply for a Safety Permit.<br />\n&nbsp;TfL worked closely with manufacturers, operators and stakeholders - including RoadPeace and Living Streets - to develop the Direct Vision Standard.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;At the same time as the Direct Vision Standard is brought into force, requirements for the London-wide Low Emission Zone will be tightened so that heavy vehicles across the capital are subject to the tough ULEZ standards. These changes show the vital role the freight industry will play in both tackling road danger and cleaning up the capital\u2019s toxic air. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Christina Calderato, Head of Transport Strategy and Planning, said: <\/strong>\u201cToday we have reached a major milestone in a scheme that will save people\u2019s lives and play a significant role in helping us achieve Vision Zero. Transforming the safety of HGVs will dramatically reduce road danger for people walking and cycling, helping us to ensure that everyone gets home safely every day. We would like to encourage all operators to check the star rating of their vehicles and take action today, by applying for a permit or fitting a Safe System.\u201d<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Councillor Julian Bell, Chair of the London Councils Transport and Environment Committee, said: <\/strong>&nbsp;\u201cLondon boroughs support the launch of Direct Vision Standard Safety Permits for HGVs using London\u2019s roads. This is a huge step forward for road safety in the capital. &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\u201cEnsuring lorry drivers have good levels of visibility will better protect vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. Increasing the number of people who walk and cycle in the capital is vital to improving our air quality and reducing congestion. We look forward to the new scheme having a positive impact on the safety of London\u2019s road network.\u201d &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Victoria Lebrec, Campaign Coordinator for RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said: <\/strong>\u201cI lost my leg in a crash with a lorry in 2014 because the driver didn\u2019t see me. Since then there have been many people killed and even more seriously injured because the lorries currently driving on London roads are not fit for purpose. It is madness to have huge, heavy vehicles with poor visibility on roads that are filled with people. Transport for London should be commended for their Safety Permit scheme. I look forward to October 2020 when the most dangerous vehicles will be off the roads \u2013 and in the meantime encourage operators to consider thinking ahead, and making their vehicles five stars.\u201d<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Stephen Edwards, Director of Policy and Communications, Living Streets said:<\/strong> \"Despite making up just four per cent of London\u2019s motor traffic, HGVs are involved in more than a fifth of pedestrian fatalities. The threat they pose to our safety has not been acceptable for a long time.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\u201cThe Direct Vision Standard is a much-needed scheme which stands to save many lives. By implementing this world-first innovation, the Mayor of London demonstrates his commitment to creating a city safer for walking and ensures London remains one of the world\u2019s leading cities.\u201d<br />\nLoughborough University researchers have been instrumental in bringing the Direct Vision Standard to where it is today, having defined and tested the scheme. &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Dr Steve Summerskill, Senior Lecturer at Loughborough University, said: <\/strong>\u201cThis successful project is the result of the efforts of a number of staff in the Loughborough Design School, who have worked as a team to produce an innovate and accurate testing technique that has been validated by vehicle manufacturers. The result will have a beneficial effect on the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in the UK capital and further afield. An impact assessment performed by TRL (Transport Research Laboratory) on behalf of the EU showed that European adoption would save hundreds of lives per year.\u201d<br />\nTfL is working with the UK Government, European Commission and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to develop international regulations on vehicle design standards.&nbsp;<br />\nThe Direct Vision Standard is part of TfL's Vision Zero commitment to tackle the number of people being killed and seriously injured on London's roads.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information please contact Sarah Murphy at <a href=\"mailto:sarah.murphy@cemex.com\">sarah.murphy@cemex.com<\/a>&nbsp;or 07557 319972<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

      "Body": "<p>It was named as the overall winner of the Planned Biodiversity-led Restoration category.<br />\nThe MPA praised the plan as a fantastic example of progressive restoration of a rock quarry to create an attractive landform and a mosaic of species-rich, locally important and distinctive \u2018Whin\u2019 grassland, agricultural grassland, woodland and hedges, and open water. The judges were impressed by the clear plan to deliver a range of habitats and realise the unique opportunity presented by quarrying to deliver regional priorities and wider landscape-scale benefits.<br />\nDonald Wilkins, Development Planner, said: \u201cThrough early engagement with the Northumberland Wildlife Trust, the RSPB, Northumberland County Council and Magnificent Meadows, it was clear that the restoration at Divethill Quarry provided an opportunity to create new areas of species rich grasslands and whin grasslands, both of which have been in decline over the past few decades.\u201d<br />\n\u201cCEMEX is delighted to have won the \u2018Planned Biodiversity-led Restoration\u2019 and will continue to work with our partner organisations to maximise the benefits from the restoration of our quarries.\u201d<br />\nThe restoration plan is to create a grassland with whin ridge/escarpment and outcrops (locally named as \u2018heughs\u2019) within a mosaic of species-rich grasslands with subtly varying soil types. Additionally, native woodland to the south and a small waterbody will add diversity and act as a hub for wildlife (both local and on passage). Whin grasslands are closely associated with the \u2018Great Whin Sill\u2019 a quartz dolerite intrusion upon which Hadrian\u2019s Wall is located.<br />\nThe thin soils found there are base-rich but nutrient-poor and prone to drought, which has led to the development of a species-rich sward, a composite of both acid- and alkali-loving plants. Whole hosts of specialist wildflowers and numerous red listed upland birds and mammals and national scarce species can be found; maiden pink, wild onion, biting stonecrop, common rock-rose, wild thyme, salad burnet, the locally scarce small-flowered and long-stalked crane\u2019s-bills. Birds and mammals include brown hare, peregrine, yellowhammer, linnet, curlew and whinchat.<\/p>"

The aggregate travels to Attercliffe from the Dove Holes quarry in Buxton, Derbyshire, and the use of rail offers considerable efficiency benefits; taking trucks off the road and reducing carbon emissions. A train burns significantly less fuel per ton-mile than road vehicles, saving around 50 per cent in CO2 emissions.<br />\nDavid Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK &amp; France, commented: \u201cThis is an incredible milestone for Attercliffe railhead, and proves how safe and effective rail can be when transporting aggregates. Most deliveries into this site take place at night, allowing us to make the most of every hour of the day and showing that CEMEX never stops when it comes to fulfilling orders and ensuring exceptional service for our customers.<br />\n\u201cUsing rail to transport aggregates is an area of our business that continues to grow and is a real focus for us, as we look to decrease road congestion and cut carbon emissions by reducing our number of truck movements.

The concrete flows and fully compacts without the need for external vibration enabling customers to place concrete in the most difficult locations whilst still maintaining all the hardened properties associated with traditional concrete. <\/p><p>In total we supplied 600m of material.

      "Body": "<p>Following this investment CEMEX\u2019s marine dredgers, which bring sand and gravel from CEMEX\u2019s licensed offshore locations in the North Sea and the English Channel into Northfleet, will be able to arrive fully laden for the first time. This will increase capacity of the site by approximately 350,000 tonnes per year to between 800,000 and 850,000 tonnes.<br />\nThis will allow CEMEX to provide more material to its on-site building products plant, reducing the need for aggregates to be transported in from other locations. This offers considerable sustainability benefits, as every dredger load reduces the need for 250 lorries on the region\u2019s busy roads.&nbsp;<br />\nPrior to this investment, the wharf at Northfleet was the only wet discharge system remaining in CEMEX\u2019s UK portfolio, and was prone to blockages and limited the products and capacity that could be brought into site. The new dry discharge system will increase the reliability and flexibility of the wharf, reducing the risk of blockages and ensuring ships can bring in exactly the right materials needed. The site can therefore better balance stocks and ensure quality, providing CEMEX\u2019s customers with an improved service.&nbsp;<br />\nLaurence Dagley, CEMEX UK Materials South\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cWe are grateful for our positive relationship with the PLA, and thankful for their support. Not only will this investment allow us to better serve the London market, opening up opportunities for growth and securing the future of the wharf, but it also promises a considerable sustainability benefit by taking trucks off the road.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX\u2019s UK strategy focuses on London and the other metropolitan markets across the country, as we believe increasing urbanisation will drive greater demand growth in these markets. It is therefore vital that our sites in these areas are developed to ensure they can support this strategy.<br />\n\u201cThanks to the funding from PLA, we have been able to invest our own resources into other assets, such as CEMEX Go Innovation, our state-of-the-art marine dredger which will arrive in the UK later this year.\u201d<br />\nRobin Mortimer, PLA chief executive, said: \u201cThis investment is central to our long-term Thames Vision work to maximise the use of tidal river between Teddington and the coast, for both freight and passenger transport.<br />\n\u201cOur aim is to do this whilst also protecting the environment and making the most of the river\u2019s social and recreational potential. Crucially, this conveyor also generates a commercial return for us, which we will be re-invest in other projects to enhance the river, for the benefit of all its users and the environment at large.\u201d<br />\nLocal MP Adam Holloway attended the opening event, commenting: \u201cIt is genuinely an honour to cut the ribbon on this wonderful project, which is such a great collaboration between the PLA and CEMEX. The river has always been a mainstay of Gravesham\u2019s economy and this very welcome new investment is vital to protecting its future as a source of employment for local people. It\u2019s also contributing towards the work the nation needs to undertake to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.<br />\n\u201cI congratulate both the PLA and CEMEX for showing such leadership on this issue.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

      "Body": "<p>It presents the <strong><a href=\"/vertua-low-carbon-concrete\" target=\"\">Vertua® low carbon concrete range<\/a><\/strong>, which includes the option to offset residual CO2 and provide a CarbonNeutral product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua range is an important step to support the Company\u2019s recently announced climate strategy, which includes an ambition of delivering net zero concrete globally by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>The range features a variety of bespoke concrete mix designs and includes the Vertua ultra zero option, which is a CarbonNeutral product. This product achieves a 70% reduction in embodied carbon emissions, with the remaining unavoidable emissions offset through working with Natural Capital Partners, a carbon offset and carbon neutrality specialist.<\/p>\n\n<p>To contribute towards the 70% reduction, CEMEX is introducing a new innovative geopolymer cement solution, which was developed at its Global Research &amp; Development Centre in Switzerland and can be used in certain applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to Vertua ultra zero, the range also features other low carbon concretes which can be used in a wide range of applications and include an option for customers to choose the added benefit of offsetting the residual CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua line of low CO2 products was originally launched by CEMEX in France in July &nbsp;2018, and following its success, the offer has now been introduced to the UK and complemented by the offsetting option to deliver net zero carbon concrete. In line with our 2050 ambition, the range will be gradually extended to other geographies in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>After engineering carbon reductions into the concrete mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the concrete CarbonNeutral from cradle-to-customer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carbon offsetting is the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX will facilitate this by investing in projects which physically remove CO2 where possible from the atmosphere, such as planting more trees or protecting against deforestation through an independently audited and verified project. A CarbonNeutral certificate is then issued to the client.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is working with Natural Capital Partners, experts in carbon offset solutions, to assure the quality of the emissions reductions, which also deliver added benefits such as increasing biodiversity and reducing poverty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Michel Andre, VP Materials Western Europe for CEMEX, commented: \u201cConcrete is an essential part of construction \u2013 it is cost effective, versatile and typically made from local materials. Concrete is vital for the infrastructure that helps provide the UK with clean water, sanitation and energy, as well as durable homes, schools, hospitals, travel networks and much more.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cHowever, we recognise future construction needs to be balanced with the effect it is having on the environment. We at CEMEX know that we can best meet these challenges by working in partnership with our clients and stakeholders to develop solutions together. We continually invest and innovate to become an environmentally friendly, sustainable leader\u2014enabling a low-carbon and resource-efficient circular economy.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Spencer, VP Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX Europe, added: \u201cWe are really proud to introduce Vertua, the UK\u2019s first CarbonNeutral® ready mixed concrete product. By offering a range of low and \u2018zero\u2019 carbon concretes, including the ability to offset the current residual CO2, we aim to make it easy for clients to make the vital transition to more sustainable choices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe know that carbon offsetting is only an interim measure while we further develop technology that is still in early stages. At present we believe it is a good way to sequester the remaining CO2 from our lower carbon solutions to take important climate action now. We are sure this will prove a relevant solution as the construction sector looks to take rapid action to improve the sustainability and climate impacts of the built environment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Climate change has been a global priority for CEMEX for many years and has brought significant progress to date. But there is a need to do more and faster. This is why CEMEX has recently announced a more ambitious climate strategy, including a new global target for CO2 emissions by 2030: a reduction of 35% to ensure alignment with the Paris Agreement commitments. This is in addition to the ambition of delivering net zero concrete globally by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon in the Vertua range using a Carbon Footprint Calculator (CO2 Tool) that follows the principles of PAS2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua range of low carbon concretes will be formally launched in the UK at Futurebuild 2020 on CEMEX\u2019s stand (F70), held between 3rd \u2013 5th March at ExCeL London.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Interview opportunity<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX will be launching Vertua at the 2020 Futurebuild exhibition. There will be opportunities to interview Richard Kershaw, CEMEX Technical Manager, and Shane Hughes, CEMEX Carbon Manager, on Tuesday 3rd March.

      "Body": "<p>RAF Coningsby is one of the UK\u2019s Quick Reaction Alert Stations which protect UK airspace. It is the home of two frontline, combat-ready squadrons and the main base for the RAF\u2019s Typhoon fighter aircraft. CEMEX\u2019s Lincoln coating plant provided the asphalt over five months as a key part of the prestigious runway resurfacing project.&nbsp;<br />\nA specific challenge of this project was the requirement for the site to always remain fully operational, so the Typhoons could be scrambled in case of an emergency. As a result, contractor Colas resurfaced a short section of the runway each night. CEMEX provided a Porous Friction Course to meet the Ministry of Defence\u2019s complex asphalt specifications, supplying up to 450 tonnes per shift.&nbsp;<br />\nJames Playford, Area Manager for Asphalt, commented: \u201cMeeting the requirements of this project required exceptional teamwork, and I am very proud of my colleagues and what we have achieved. Initially, we were only expecting to supply the surface course material, however once the job had started the binder course layers also had to be replaced, which greatly increased the amount of product needed.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cTherefore, coordination between several different areas of the business was vital. Our aggregates team at Roan Edge Quarry was the only site that could supply us with the required premium quality hardstone and so had to work under considerable pressure; the technical team ensured we met the product specification; the sales team engaged with Colas; while the operational team fulfilled every single order to time, keeping the plant running day and night throughout the project.<br />\n\u201cWe wanted Colas to be reassured from the start of this high-profile scheme that we were the right supplier for this project, with the resources to create the perfect product. We carried out extensive mix testing and laying trials, as well providing a full operational capability tour of the asphalt plant. This comprehensive and dedicated approach paid off and we are pleased the project has been such a success.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX worked for UK infrastructure contractor Colas on the project. Procurement Manager Steve Bryant commented: \u201cWe were very impressed by CEMEX\u2019s collaborative approach, which ensured they could meet the intricate specificities of the project in the constrained timeframe. The finished runaway is a quality surface that will play a key part in this site\u2019s defence work.

But this is the same of our \u201cStop and Think\u201d ensuring all hazards have been identified and controls put in place before continuing.

ISOCLEAN WHO 1 is an alcoholic solution containing 70 to 80% ethanol. The reagents are ethanol 96%, hydrogen peroxide 3%, glycerol 98%, and sterile distilled or boiled cold water. The second formulation, ISOCLEAN WHO 2, is based on 70 to 80% propan-2-ol. In this instance, the alcohol component is isopropyl alcohol 99.8% instead of ethanol.

CEMEX remains committed to the UK and its European business, which is one of the company\u2019s largest regions, and will continue to have a strong national presence. This proposal will allow CEMEX to optimise the network it has available across the region. This is part of the ongoing strategy to strengthen the CEMEX portfolio and secure its place as a global leader in the industry.&nbsp;<br />\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has not influenced the decision to consider mothballing the South Ferriby Plant.<br />\nCEMEX customers will be supplied from the company\u2019s existing cement network. CEMEX\u2019s supply chain plan and commercial management will ensure that customer service will be maintained at all times. CEMEX will continue to supply high quality products in line with customer expectations.<br />\nStrategic growth in the UK will be focused in the future on those markets most attractive to CEMEX, such as the larger metropolitan markets where demand and profitability will be strongest. CEMEX invested more than £52m in new capital projects during 2019, alongside significant ongoing investment into the UK cement business, demonstrating the continued importance of this area to the company.<br />\nEnds.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high quality products and reliable services.&nbsp;The company has a substantial integrated business in the United Kingdom encompassing, among other things, cement production, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, asphalt, and paving solutions.

Once restored the site will form part of a wider network of heath and woodland mosaics that includes Cannock Chase.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nOvertime the site has become dominated by bracken and bramble with scrub starting to encroach, without undertaking vital management the heathland would be lost, and these priority species will lose their home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A site visit to Rugeley took place in early March, before physical distancing, with Alex Finn from the CEMEX Restoration Team; Gareth Fenna, Quarry Manager; Jenny Oldroyd, RSPB Partnership Advisor; Jaclyn Lake, Natural England; and Wesley Parnell, RSPB heathland management team, to make an initial overview assessment of the heath\u2019s management needs. It was a really positive visit with all parties keen to work together. The weather was kind and the warm spring sunshine gave some great wildlife sightings too, with Woodlark calling, Goshawk seen and even Adder giving us a hiss, as we accidentally disturbed it, before sliding off and vanishing under the bracken.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX are working in-partnership with the RSPB, and liaising with Natural England, to pull together a plan to manage the adjacent land that is part of the SAC. This plan will be a long-term commitment by CEMEX; the vision is to bring back a more diverse structure to the heath; reduce bracken cover and manage scrub. This is going to be challenging in such an open area. With the first phase being a survey to identify which areas to prioritise management and to identify wildlife that use the site. After which a management plan will be drafted, and the vital management work started.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: Dartford Warbler taken by Tim Melling.<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

      "Display Title": "CEMEX Highlights Products & Services that Help Meet Challenge of Site Working Requirements",
      "Body": "<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Products that can reduce the use of additional materials and equipment and working in confined spaces, while allowing effective use of labour and maintaining physical distance guidelines are likely to be of increased demand as construction resumes.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Options from CEMEX to support these requirements include high performance concrete solutions, mortars and its digital platform CEMEX Go.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">For example, Evolution™, CEMEX\u2019s self-compacting concrete range, which can spread into place, fill formwork, and encapsulate even the most congested reinforcement by means of its own weight, with little or no vibration. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">This self-compacting concrete is ideal for casting heavily reinforced sections or can be placed where there can be no access to vibrators for compaction and in complex shapes of formwork which may otherwise be impossible to cast, giving a far superior surface to conventional concrete.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">As self-compacting concrete can flow from a single point* it is self-levelling, self-compacting and eliminates the need to hire expensive vibration equipment or use additional labour. This offers both health &amp; safety and cost benefits. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Additionally, the Advanced fibre reinforced concretes, a range of fibre reinforced ready-mix concretes, containing a blend of polypropylene micro fibres and engineered macro fibre or steel fibre solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">There are many features of fibre reinforced concrete, however the main one is the reduction or elimination of crack control steel mesh. This provides a number of benefits, including a reduction in material delivered, stored and handled on site and the minimisation of labour required for cutting and placing steel reinforcement. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Rapid hardening concrete, such as CEMEX\u2019s Promptis, can also help save valuable time during construction. Promptis has similar characteristics to conventional concrete but it can reach accelerated early strength after just six hours while still maintaining initial flow properties and consistence for up to 120 minutes. Formwork can be stripped after only six hours (subject to mix design and guidance). Benefits of this type of product include increased productivity, cost savings and removal of on-site delays.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Meanwhile, CEMEX\u2019s factory produced mortars offer clean, efficient production with reduced wastage and increased productivity on site. CEMEX can provide dry mortar in a silo, ready-to-use wet mortar and dry bagged mortar, meaning there is a solution available whatever the size of the site or requirements of the job. The dry silo systems also reduce manual handling and the risk of injury in production, for improved health and safety. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Finally, the CEMEX Go digital platform allows customers to easily order online, whatever their location. This means they can manage their account quickly and efficiently, including tracking deliveries, receiving digital invoices, placing and amending orders, without having to be in the office. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Richard Kershaw, Technical Manager for CEMEX Materials UK, commented: \u201cWith safe working on site paramount and physical distancing guidelines still in effect, products that minimise labour, contribute to physical distance and reduce additional materials or equipment on site whilst simultaneously maximising productivity are now essential.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">\u201cWe therefore wanted to identify and highlight which of our products and services would be of most use to our customers in this regard. Using a self-levelling concrete, or our digital ordering platform for instance, can ease the challenge of meeting public health guidelines while continuing operations, ensuring a safe yet productive site. As a business, CEMEX continues to provide a full service as it has done throughout the pandemic and we are ready to meet our customers\u2019 needs and support their projects, whatever the requirements.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about the products and services CEMEX offers to help customers meet site working requirements, visit <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/physical-distancing-on-construction-sites\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/physical-distancing-on-construction-sites<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<br />\n* &nbsp;On large pours more than one point may be required<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

It follows a recent letter sent by over 200 business leaders to the Prime Minister calling for an economic recovery aligned with the UK\u2019s climate and environmental goals [3] and recommends key policies to deliver these types of projects on the ground.<br />\nReacting to the publication of the briefing, Nick Molho, Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, said: \u201cThere has rarely been a time when the economic, social and environmental agendas have been so closely aligned. It is clear from the case studies in our briefing that incentivising low carbon and nature restoration projects as part of the UK\u2019s recovery plan could do much to tackle economic and social concerns around jobs, regional inequality, long-term competitiveness and resilience.\u201d<br />\nToday\u2019s policy briefing argues that an economic recovery focused on stimulating low carbon and nature restoration projects could deliver key benefits, including:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>addressing regional inequality and unemployment;<\/li>\n\t<li>strengthening the UK\u2019s economic competitiveness and productivity through investment in the sectors and technologies of the future;<\/li>\n\t<li>delivering critical public goods, including clean air, better health and improved resilience to future environmental shocks;<\/li>\n\t<li>building a more resilient financial system fit to withstand future climate shocks;<\/li>\n\t<li>delivering the Global Britain agenda by strengthening the UK government\u2019s influence ahead of the G7 and COP26 summits that it will be hosting in 2021 and enabling UK businesses to be competitive providers of low carbon goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Nick Molho added: \u201cPutting an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at the heart of the UK\u2019s economic recovery need not be overly reliant on public money. Targeted public investment will be important to support early stage innovation in areas such as hydrogen and carbon capture but a lot of the heavy lifting can be done through the introduction of clear public policy signals to attract private sector investment in areas such as energy efficiency, charging infrastructure and natural capital projects.\u201d<br />\nPeter Simpson, Chief Executive, Anglian Water, said: \u201cThe need for economic recovery from Covid-19 in the face of the ever more pressing climate emergency presents business leaders not just with an opportunity to create a fairer, more sustainable future, but a responsibility to do so. I believe we can recover from this pandemic in a way that brings&nbsp;economic, environmental and social prosperity. We stand ready to work with government and our communities on a resilient, low carbon future that leaves nobody behind.\u201d<br />\nAndy Wales, Chief Digital Impact and Sustainability Officer at BT, said: \u201cAs we emerge from the crisis caused by Covid-19, government, businesses and policymakers must put action on climate at the heart of their efforts to revive the economy. BT is stepping up on climate action by backing new green technologies through our Green Tech Innovation Platform and by investing in the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure. We want to encourage and help others to do the same - creating a more sustainable, resilient, low carbon economy.\u201d<br />\nMartin Casey, Director Public Affairs Europe at CEMEX, said: \u201cAligning the economic recovery package with the UK\u2019s net zero emissions goal presents great opportunities for CEMEX. Reducing emissions is not limited to our production process but to the whole life cycle of our products and we have committed globally to reach net zero concrete by 2050. We are committed to continue reducing our direct and indirect emissions in our processes, both through the maximization of the traditional CO2 reduction levers and through implementing Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and other carbon innovative technologies. Our aim is to enable the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings and climate resilient infrastructures. Setting a clear policy direction for restarting the economy will enable the private sector to play its part in the recovery in a way that advances our climate and environmental goals.\u201d<br />\nSteve Andrews, CEO at Earthwatch Europe, said: \u201cIt is heartening to see so many organisations calling on Government to ensure a fairer, greener recovery post-COVID-19. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re listening. If COVID-19 and lockdown has taught us anything, it is the need to take science seriously and for Government to focus now, with urgency, on threats that seem beyond the electoral cycle.\u201d<br />\nAndy Walker, Technical Marketing Director at Johnson Matthey, said: \u201cAs this policy briefing outlines, the government has a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d to accelerate the transition to a low carbon and environmentally resilient economy as it develops and implements its strategy to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. Since the Climate Change Act was passed, the UK has successfully demonstrated that economic growth can go hand in hand with emissions reductions, further supporting the widely held view that measures which cut greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate the economy can be extremely effective in supporting jobs and<br />\neconomic growth. This \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d approach has the additional benefit of putting the UK on track to deliver our 2050 net zero commitments, strengthening our leadership and influence at the upcoming COP26 and G7 summits, as well as generating lasting social, competitiveness and resilience benefits.\u201d<br />\nAlexander Burr, Global ESG Public Policy Analyst at Legal and General Investment Management, said: \u201cThe UK government is faced with a unique opportunity to show that we are not returning to \u2018business as usual\u2019 through a recovery package that accelerates green economic growth. Over recent weeks, businesses and investors have been pledging their willingness and support for this agenda. The government should build on this foundation, bringing forward mandatory climate reporting and broadening its reach. Investors like LGIM<br />\nneed greater transparency and comparability from companies on their climate-related risks and opportunities, to direct capital into \u2018green\u2019 projects at scale. As we have seen lately, there is such a thing as being too late \u2013 it is time to act now!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power said: \u201cThere is now a compelling case for accelerating investment in a cleaner, greener society to deliver positive outcomes for both the economy and the environment. Positive outcomes that will benefit all of us thanks to cleaner power, cleaner home heating and cleaner transport. We must make our recovery green \u2013 delivering the much-needed jobs and investment that will get people, businesses, towns and cities back on their feet while cleaning up the environment and decarbonising the<br />\neconomy. The government cannot let this moment pass the country by.\u201d<br />\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be at the forefront of developing green infrastructure projects that will do just that. For example, partnering with Scottish Government and Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks to support the shift to electric vehicles in a way that will ensure fair and equal access for all. Developments like this will be a real game-changer in moving us closer to net zero \u2013 as well as supporting the economy \u2013 and that\u2019s why the two can, and must, go hand in hand. Only by doing that can we all achieve a cleaner and&nbsp;greener future \u2013 a better future \u2013 quicker.\u201d<br />\nMaria Connolly, Head of Clean Energy &amp; Real Estate at TLT LLP, said: \u201cThe positive impact that the last few months has had on the environment means that as we\u2019re looking forward the question that\u2019s being asked is, could a green recovery bolster the economy and accelerate our drive towards net zero by emphasising sustainable business practices and modern green industry over more traditional carbon intensive sectors? An economic recovery which places an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at its core would, without a doubt, also refocus growth, policy development and funding. While the backing of the financial sector is need to achieve this vision, for many banks and funders clean energy assets are still viewed as a stable investment, and if you consider the upscale in clean energy generation \u2013 an estimated 90GW of wind energy, 80GW of solar power and 30GW of energy storage - that will be required to achieve net zero then this represents an exciting opportunity to drive economic growth by creating jobs and developing local supply chains based on clean energy.\u201d<br />\nBevis Watts, CEO of Triodos Bank UK, said: \u201cWe now have a window of opportunity, as we seek to overcome the challenges of the coronavirus crisis. A recovery should seek to increase resilience across all areas of society and focus on shaping a more inclusive and low-carbon economy. Triodos has always been a pioneer in sustainable finance \u2013 most recently we have been looking at linking the economic and societal benefits we take for granted from nature to real investment in its restoration. We need collaborative action to develop an economy linked to societal health and environmental limits and require a financial sector that proactively looks for solutions to achieve that. Simply a move to avoiding harm is not enough.\u201d<br />\nJulia Barrett, Chief Sustainability Officer at Willmott Dixon, said: \u201cWe welcome this briefing from the Aldersgate Group, and believe that putting an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at the heart of the recovery will ensure that the UK economy is more competitive in the long-term whilst being more resilient to future risks. We believe that by investing in a nationwide retrofit programme supported by clear policy signals, government could deliver rapid localised job creation, whilst addressing the social&nbsp; inequalities associated with fuel poverty and poor health associated with living in cold homes. This is an essential step on our journey to net zero emissions as 80% of the buildings that will exist in 2050 are<br />\nhere now.\u201d<br />\nDarren Moorcroft, CEO of the Woodland Trust, said: \u201cA resilient economy and society require a resilient environment. This welcome work by the Aldersgate Group shows how vital&nbsp;it is that we seize this moment and ensure that actions to reboot the economy set us firmly on the road to net zero and show world leading ambition when it comes to restoring our natural environment. Protecting, restoring and expanding native tree cover \u2013 with all the social, economic and environmental benefits that will bring - belongs at the heart of any \u2018green recovery\u2019 worthy of the name. The Woodland Trust has a powerful record of delivery and stands ready to play its part - working alongside business, government and our NGO partners to help transform our nation into a better place for people and wildlife.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>\u2014ENDS\u2014<br />\nNotes to Editor<\/strong><br />\nThe Aldersgate Group is an alliance of leaders from business, politics and civil society that drives action for a sustainable economy.

It also presents significant time savings, which helps to limit the disruption to pedestrians and other road users and achieve a faster rate of job completion. In addition, multi-layer construction can often lead to damage in underlying layers resulting in further delays and spiralling costs.<br />\nFor those looking to incorporate more eco-friendly products into their construction projects, VIAPATH offers real sustainability benefits. It achieves a carbon footprint reduction for a project by requiring less fuel use during the paving operation, less tack coat/bond coat and lower on-site wastage.&nbsp;<br />\nA further benefit of this single layer solution is that it addresses a common cause of potholes caused by traditional pavement construction. Typically, a horizontal joint would be required between the binder course and surface course layers which presents an inherent risk to the ingress of water. With VIAPATH this joint is eliminated, thus improving the overall structural durability of the pavement.<br />\nMartin Ashfield, Technical Manager for Asphalt &amp; Paving, CEMEX Europe, commented: \u201cAs more and more of us adapt to new ways of sustainable travelling that also eases pressure on public transport, the development of cycle and footpaths is critical.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cFortunately, VIAPATH is a premium-quality asphalt solution that has been specifically designed to replace surface, regulating or binder courses in a single pass.

The 2020 Competition remains open until July 26, 2020.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arqlite gets support from large investors, also working on circular economy issues, such as Kamay Ventures, a venture capital fund made up of Arcor SAIC and Coca-Cola Argentina, and Chriss Graff, founder of the NYC Curb-To-Market Challenge, among others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>MONTERREY, MEXICO. JUNE 30, 2020 \u2013 CEMEX Ventures, CEMEX's Corporate Venture Capital and open innovation unit, today announced its investment in Arqlite SPC, a US company based in California. Arqlite SPC processes unrecyclable plastic waste into artificial gravel that avoids the use of natural quarry aggregates and boulders in the production of light concrete with a low CO2 footprint and installs drainage beds for construction and landscaping. CEMEX Ventures\u2019 new alliance with Arqlite SPC offers an innovative solution around the construction industry\u2019s circular economy: it gives a second life to plastic and reduces the carbon footprint and operating costs of handling and producing construction materials such as aggregates and concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arqlite SPC began its research and development process in Argentina in 2016 and has developed an innovative technology that allows most of the plastic waste to be recycled instead of disposal at a landfill or polluting the environment. The light aggregates it produces represent a great advance in sustainable construction, multiplying thermal and acoustic insulation by 10 times compared to mineral aggregates and offering better construction quality and greater energy conservation. The aggregate is three times lighter than stone, making it excellent for low CO2 concrete that is also intended to reduce required structural supports and to significantly lower transportation costs. The low thermal conductivity of plastic reduces its reaction to extreme temperature variations and, therefore, the possibility of fracturing or altering the concrete mix.<\/p>\n\n<p>One million plastic bottles are purchased every minute and 500 billion plastic bags are used annually. In addition, eight million tons end up in oceans every year, threatening marine life. For this reason, CEMEX Ventures and Arqlite SPC offer a low-cost technological solution, capable of processing the vast majority of plastic waste as raw material. Due mainly to the lack of environmental awareness and existing technological limitations, it is estimated that only 7% of the 300 million tons of plastic waste generated is finally recycled.<\/p>\n\n<p>This investment by CEMEX Ventures is part of CEMEX's ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete to all of its customers globally by 2050, as this solution uses practically all types of plastics as raw material, preventing them from ending up in landfills or unsustainable destinations.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlastic waste processing is a global problem with no large-scale solution so far. We believe that, due to the large volume of material used by the construction industry, we can recycle much of this plastic waste, making us a solution to this problem, while generating construction materials with better functionality and a lower carbon footprint. That is why this investment has a double mission: to help mitigate the great problem of plastic waste and, simultaneously, to produce construction materials with a low CO2 footprint,\" said Cristina Aparicio, Head of CEMEX Ventures investment in Arqlite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arqlite SPC installs version 2.0 of its technology in its new factory in Santa Ana, California, based on developments in Argentina. This new production plant has machinery from different European countries, which, added to the technology designed by the company itself locally, will reach a capacity of 18 thousand tons per year. Its location is strategic for CEMEX, since it is within the radius of several of its concrete and aggregate operations in the California area. In addition, Arqlite already has agreements to recycle plastics from large generators throughout the Los Angeles region and works with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to continue innovating in the construction industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Ventures has joined as investor to Kamay Ventures, venture capital fund of Grupo Arcor SAIC and Coca Cola Argentina, and Chris Graff, founder of NYC Curb-To-Market Challenge, and successful businessman in the manufacturing industry, among others. The good reception to this innovative solution focused on the circular economy has generated interest from numerous actors in different industries, making it easy to scale and implement this solution across various geographies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sebastián Sajoux, CEO and founder of Arqlite SPC, said, \u201cOur technology can become a key player in a large market industry. We have developed a large-scale solution to a large-scale problem.\" Arqlite, which was also the winner of CEMEX Ventures Global Construction Startup Competition 2019, invites entrepreneurs to participate in the 2020 edition of the Competition, which remains open until July 26, 2020. \u201cFor Arqlite SPC, being part of the Global Construction Startup Competition 2019 was very important because working together and being validated by a company like CEMEX Ventures opens new doors for us and helps our brand, which is still small, to reach other large companies that are open to receiving us and hearing about our proposal.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2017, CEMEX Ventures focuses on helping to solve the main challenges and capitalize on the opportunity areas in the construction ecosystem through sustainable solutions. CEMEX Ventures has created an open and collaborative platform to lead the revolution of the construction industry by engaging startups, entrepreneurs, universities, and other relevant actors to tackle the industry's toughest challenges and shape tomorrow's value ecosystem.<br />\nFor more information about CEMEX Ventures, please visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemexventures.com/\">https://www.cemexventures.com/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

By using this low carbon concrete, a total of 12 tonnes of carbon should be saved once deliveries are complete, with an additional 17 tonnes of residual CO2 offset. &nbsp;<br />\nDiscussions are continuing as to how this technology can be adopted on further sites across the HS2 route.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>HS2 aims to build the most sustainable highspeed railway in the world and is driving innovation in design, construction and operation to minimise its entire carbon footprint. In order to become the UK\u2019s most environmentally responsible infrastructure project, HS2 has set a carbon reduction target of 50% target for its contractors on construction baselines for Phase One civil assets (such as tunnels, viaducts and cuttings), stations and railway systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Peter Miller, Environment Director, HS2 Ltd said:<br />\n\u201cWe know that climate change is the greatest long-term threat to Britain\u2019s security and prosperity. The Government has set a target for net-zero emissions by 2050 and HS2 is playing its part in meeting that challenge.<br />\n\u201cUsing innovative techniques and products in the construction of the new high speed railway, we can not only build HS2 more sustainably, but we can lead by example, showing how the construction sector can help deliver Britain\u2019s cleaner greener future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Dan Hunt, Programme Director at Costain Skanska joint venture said:<br />\n\u201cWorking closely with our supply chain, CSjv has identified many ways to maximise our environmental credentials, leading to more than 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) saved to date. We have focused on identifying innovations and efficiencies throughout our whole programme, from our power supplies and fuel sources through to working methodology by reducing and recycling materials.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe have worked hard to reduce the amount of concrete needed across the programme and by working with CEMEX, we have further reduced our carbon footprint of our works.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Richard Kershaw, Technical Manager for Materials at CEMEX UK, said:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are proud to have supplied this HS2 site with our Vertua concrete, the first time this low-carbon product has been used in our country\u2019s capital. We know that minimising the carbon footprint for the HS2 project is of real importance, and our Vertua concrete offers an easy way to make a more sustainable choice for such an important product. We look forward to exploring the other opportunities for Vertua to be used as part of HS2 .\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>When operational HS2 will offer people a cleaner, greener way to travel with lower carbon emissions per passenger kilometre, than cars and domestic air travel. HS2 trains will be highly energy efficient and powered by electricity from an increasingly decarbonised electricity grid. In the future, with electricity generation fully decarbonised, travelling on HS2 will be a zero-carbon activity. In addition HS2 will free up extra space on the existing rail network. It will take cars and lorries off the road and reduce the need for domestic air travel. This will reduce transport carbon emissions and improve air quality.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nENDS<br />\nNotes to Editors&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

      "Body": "<p>CEMEX Ventures, CEMEX's Corporate Venture Capital and open innovation unit, announced today its investment in Modulous, a company with a disruptive offsite construction system, enabled by a digital platform, to allow the high-speed delivery of quality, sustainable and affordable homes. This will transform the construction process as it is currently known, providing the industry with a unique modular construction solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>It has become apparent that modular construction, in its current form, is not efficient. Although it does improve speed and quality of the build process, it needs to make significant improvements to solve the housing crisis. London-based startup Modulous offers a new approach to increase the home production for the UK and support ambitions to meet the housing requirements for the year 2050, when 3 billion people are expected to live in cities, representing 70% of the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Modulous aims to achieve this through a new construction approach based on a highly engineered kit-of-parts that enables the delivery of high-quality affordable homes at scale and pace. The software platform leverages artificial intelligence, generative design and 5D BIM modelling providing a fully integrated supply chain solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>By digitizing the entire materials supply chain management, Modulous reduces the time and cost overruns common in the construction process. By decentralizing operations this solution can scale rapidly as assembly of the modules is carried out by companies local to the final site. The construction system is easy to assemble, converting the kit of parts into homes in hours instead of months, and further reducing the industry shortage of professionalization.<\/p>\n\n<p>Through their innovative approach, Modulous has already secured a large pipeline of projects across the UK and Europe. It is currently preparing the delivery of a £6.5m residential scheme in London using its smart design and construction system that will achieve completion 12 months ahead of schedule.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"By including Modulous in our portfolio, we offer the industry a unique offsite construction model\" said Mateo Zimermmann, head of CEMEX Ventures investment in Modulous. \"After several years of exploring how this segment is advancing, we placed our trust in this team that perfectly combines engineers, designers, and technological developers. The Modulous innovative approach enables the supply chain to deliver sustainable and high-quality homes, significantly reducing time and costs. Modulous does not require additional capex, which makes it globally scalable. This team is going to revolutionise the residential development industry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Although we are currently focused on the south of England, where we expect to achieve sales of £25 million in the pilot year, we want to offer a global solution to housing needs in Europe,\" said Chris Bone, Co-Founder and Managing Director by Modulous. \"We are delighted to be part of CEMEX's global vision for offsite construction and future collaborations to launch advanced and tailored materials through collaboration in research and development. Having the support and access to customers and suppliers of CEMEX and CEMEX Ventures makes us a more relevant player in the industry where we participate\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Modulous is one of the winners of the 2020 Construction Startup Competition, the annual startup challenge organized by CEMEX Ventures. This startup was also part of the Top 50 ConTech Startups list in 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>About Modulous<br />\nModulous is an award winning, London-based construction technology business that has developed a digital platform and smart kit of parts to enable the delivery of high-quality, sustainable and affordable homes, at scale and pace.

      "Body": "<p>The Tunnel is being built to upgrade London\u2019s sewer system to cope with its growing population. Currently, London relies on a 150-year-old sewer system built for a population less than half its current size. As a result, during periods of heavy rain, the current infrastructure can become overwhelmed.<br />\nThe new 25km tunnel will intercept, store and transfer sewage waste away from the River Thames.&nbsp;<br />\nStarting in Acton, west London, the Thames Tideway Tunnel will travel through the heart of London at depths of between 30 and 60 metres, using gravity to transfer waste eastwards and be processed and dealt with in a modern state of the art facility.<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s primary lining spray concrete is being used for the shafts and launch tunnels in the central part of the project \u2013 a 12.5km stretch of the tunnel moving under central London which is being constructed by a joint venture between Ferrovial Construction and Laing O\u2019Rourke (FLO). The concrete is sprayed from bottom to top in one continuous operation until the shaft wall is complete. An extremely complicated mix is required, consisting of eight separate constituents which when combined give a high strength of +60N/mm2, consistence&nbsp;of 600mm flow and a consistence flow&nbsp;of two hours.&nbsp;<br />\nWhen sprayed it has to adhere to the tunnel or shaft wall / ceiling and gain strength immediately to a high rate of strength gain requirements. The concrete also needs to be highly pumpable, in some cases with a pipeline length of up to 400m.<br />\nCEMEX manufactures the product at its dedicated Spray Concrete plant in Buxton, from where it is transported into central London at rates that peak at around 3,000 tonnes per month. Supply is likely to continue for a few months, although this may need to be extended due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;<br />\nSergio Menendez, President of CEMEX Europe, Middle East, Africa &amp; Asia, said: \u201cThe Tideway project is one of incredible scale which will solve serious capacity issues with London\u2019s sewer system and have considerable benefits for the area\u2019s wildlife and population, while also creating jobs, a rejuvenated river economy and new areas of public space.<br />\n\u201cThis is a serious piece of engineering, and we\u2019re proud to be working with world-class contractors to build this key infrastructure in the most sustainable and cost-effective way possible for one of the world\u2019s greatest cities.&nbsp;<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, added: \u201cOur sprayed concrete forms a key part of the central part of the tunnel and it was vital to get the complicated mix right. Fortunately, we have worked with FLO before and so there was already an understanding of the works required and the performance required from the material to be supplied.\u201d<br />\nBorja Trashorras, Project Manager at FLO\u2019s Albert Embankment site, said: \u201cCEMEX\u2019s primary lining spray concrete provided a good solution at Albert Embankment Foreshore for the construction of both connection tunnels and our 53m drop shaft through some challenging ground conditions. Having sprayed over 5,000 tonnes for this package of works meant we built a strong and reliable line of communication with CEMEX. Logistical planning was essential in the delivery of these works due to our central London location which CEMEX was able to co-ordinate and support with ease.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

      "Body": "<p>Together with Bowker, its logistics partner at Selby, and Potter Space (owners of the business park where Selby is located), more than £200,000 has been invested into new rail freight infrastructure and facilities, ensuring the ongoing reliability of the service from this site and enabling the team to increase the number of trains that can run a week.<br />\nConsiderable improvements have been made to the track that travels off the main line and into the Selby depot. Following the investment, around 70 per cent of the track has been completely replaced, with other upgrades such as concrete sleepers made to improve the condition of the track further, and the installation of new loading bays.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, Bowker have made significant investment in its stone discharge facilities at Selby; upgrading safety features to go beyond legislative requirements as well as making significant improvements to equipment and enhancing critical components increasing reliability.&nbsp;<br />\nNeil Bowker, Bowker\u2019s Commercial Director, said: \u201cThe features, including new guards and fencing, are focussed on operator safety; and in general, the improvements will deliver reductions in down time during critical discharge periods. The significant investment demonstrates the commitment Bowker have made to the CEMEX partnership.\u201d<br />\nAs a result of the developments made at the Selby site, the team have been able to increase the number of services run from this depot to three a week. This means an extra 90,000 tonnes of material can be moved by train, taking trucks off the road and maximising the use of rail as a sustainable mode of transport. All this helps support CEMEX\u2019s climate objectives and minimises its impact on the environment.<br />\nDave Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK and France, commented: \u201cWe continue to invest heavily into our rail operations across the country, as this allows us to grow volumes and increase the services we offer. The works at Selby were the latest part of our development programme and it was fantastic to partner with Bowker and Potter Space on the many improvements that have been made \u2013 improvements that will enable us to better and more safely support our customers.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cEnhancing the sustainability of our business is a key priority and the use of rail forms an important part of this \u2013 as every rail freight service removes trucks from the road and achieves additional carbon savings. These investments help us to support CEMEX\u2019s climate initiatives and be a more responsible company.\u201d<br />\nJason Rockett, managing director of Potter Space, added, \u201cPotter Space has a proven track record of working together with customers, so we were pleased to work in partnership with both CEMEX and Bowker at our Potter Space Selby business park. All three parties recognise the value and benefit of rail transportation, so we were delighted to jointly invest in the new rail infrastructure to help meet the needs of CEMEX and support its long-term business plans.\u201d<br />\nThese improvements come as part of a wider investment into Selby, with £0.5million planned for three new bitumen tanks and a reprocessed asphalt system.

      "Summary": "Global building materials solutions supplier CEMEX is proud to present VIALOW, a new addition to the VERTUA family of low carbon and sustainable building solutions. VIALOW is a reduced carbon asphalt which comes with the option to offset residual CO2 to make it a CarbonNeutral® product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.",

      "Display Title": "CEMEX Launches \"VIALOW\" Asphalt - A CarbonNeutral®️ Product",
      "Body": "<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy in February 2020, and in its European operations reduced its CO2 emissions by close to 35% as of December 31st, 2020, ten years ahead of the target date. CEMEX also declared a 55% CO2 reduction target for its European Operations, aligning with the European Commission goal for all member states.<br />\nVIALOW is a new range of low temperature, low carbon asphalts from CEMEX, which uses a specially formulated bitumen additive to enable manufacture at up to 40°C lower than standard asphalt mixes with no compromise in performance, with the added benefit of achieving up to 20% reduction in embodied carbon emissions.&nbsp;<br />\nThe range includes the VIALOW Zero option, which is a CarbonNeutral product, and complements the CEMEX VERTUA range of low carbon building solutions, further enhancing CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action strategy \u2013 committed to Net Zero CO2. As technology and the industry shifts toward low carbon asphalt, the best interim way to sequester the rest of the CO2 footprint, to make it a carbon neutral product, is through carbon offsetting. To do this we are working with Natural Capital Partners, an award-winning expert on carbon neutrality and climate finance, that is harnessing the power of business to create a more sustainable world.<\/p>\n\n<p>VIALOW offers customers a host of other benefits alongside its sustainability credentials. The lower temperature of the manufacturing process can also help to improve the long-term performance and durability of the asphalt, as high temperature in conventional mixes leads to more oxidative hardening of bitumen than is seen in lower temperature variants.<br />\nReduced temperature asphalt also offers safety and environmental benefits which include a reduced risk of burns and lower odours, providing a safer and more pleasant working environment for both workers and neighbours to the construction site. The reduced mixing and paving temperatures of low temperature asphalt can reduce fume generation by around 50% for approximately each 10°C reduction in temperature.<br />\nFurthermore, by virtue of being a low temperature asphalt, VIALOW allows the re-opening of a jobsite more quickly after completion of road works, as the asphalt reaches appropriate trafficking temperatures faster than conventional hot mix asphalt. Alongside minimising disruption and enabling construction programmes to remain on time, this offers further benefits to the environment, as statistics show that stationary traffic caused by road closures creates four times as many pollutants when compared to moving vehicles.<br />\nThe launch of this range follows a report from the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Highways which identified warm mix asphalts (WMA) as an underutilised opportunity to reduce the CO2 emissions associated with asphalt production for road infrastructure. At the time of publishing, the report found that WMAs represent less than 4% of UK asphalt production, yet if all asphalt production in Great Britain had been switched to WMA, it would have saved at least 61,000 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 the equivalent of cutting almost 300 million miles of car journeys.<br />\nCarl Platt, Director of Asphalt, Paving, and Building Products for Europe, commented: \u201cAsphalt is an essential part of our country\u2019s infrastructure; roads provide access to employment, social, health and education services, provide access to more areas and stimulate economic and social development. However, we recognise that future construction needs to be balanced with the effect it is having on the environment.\u201d<br />\n\u201cCEMEX is totally committed to improving the sustainability of its operations and supporting its customers to do the same. With the launch of VIALOW, CEMEX aims to make it simple for customers to choose more sustainable and environmentally-friendly asphalts that have a lower embodied carbon, offset residual emissions and help drive vital change.<br />\n\u201cMoreover, this industry-leading range of low temperature asphalt is designed to produce faster construction times, minimise disruption and reduce road maintenance costs alongside the added benefit of a carbon footprint reduction.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX Urbanisation Solutions is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on our Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.&nbsp;<br />\nVIALOW is available all year round in all Asphalt Concrete Base, Binder and Surface courses as well as Hot Rolled Asphalt (only where pre coated chippings are not required), Stone Mastic Asphalt and the full Proprietary range.<br />\nAfter engineering carbon reductions into the asphalt mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction, transportation and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the asphalt CarbonNeutral from cradle-to-customer.<br />\nCarbon offsetting is the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX will facilitate this by financing projects which physically remove CO2 from the atmosphere, such as planting trees. A CarbonNeutral certificate is then issued to the client.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX calculates the embodied carbon (as CO2e) in the VIALOW range using a Carbon Footprint Calculator in accordance with relevant standards and guidance.&nbsp;<br />\nFor more information about VIALOW visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/vialow-low-temperature-asphalt-for-faster-construction\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/vialow-low-temperature-asphalt-for-faster-construction<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

This site has a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) in place, and despite the impact of the Coronavirus the team have made good progress on this over the last year.<br />\nThe Denge team have a great relationship with the adjacent RSPB nature reserve at Dungeness. Together they have removed scrub from the islands in the quarry\u2019s saline lagoon (five Islands and several peninsulas in this lagoon have been created as part of the restoration). Scrub, if left, would turn into woodland and make islands unsuitable for ground nesting birds. The removal activity maintains the wildlife value and protects the important habitat it provides for numerous species of birds and insects.<\/p>\n\n<p>Being coastal, Denge is key for breeding wetland birds, particularly sea birds. Decoy nesting gulls have also been installed to encourage Black Headed Gulls and Common Tern to nest in safe nonoperational areas, on the shingle islands. The team have monitored the site for bryophyte plants (such as moss, liverworts and hornworts) with a view to managing the negative impacts of invasive non-native species. One such species is Crassula Helmsii (New Zealand \u2013 Stonecrop), which can form dense, tangled growth of stems underwater, on the shoreline. These choke out native wildlife, such as the endangered Sussex Emerald moth currently found in one area of Dungeness, where it lives in vegetated shingle.<br />\nOver the last year, the team at Denge have spotted 158 species of wildlife, including birds such as Gadwall, Tufted Duck, Little Grebe, Black Headed Gull and Common Tern and three types of reptile: Adder, Grass Snake and Common Lizard.<br />\nFor 2021 and beyond, a comprehensive list of actions have been decided, and these include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Creating fish reefs using large willow<\/li>\n\t<li>Creating areas of wild carrot, fenced, to prevent rabbits<\/li>\n\t<li>Profiling margins for reedbed growth<\/li>\n\t<li>Checking of gabion baskets and island stability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>With these actions, the site\u2019s wider BMP (BAP) will help ensure that Denge provides a diverse and developing environment for wildlife.<br />\nWell done to all those at the site and in the UK Sustainability team who are working hard to enhance Denge\u2019s eco credentials!&nbsp;<\/p>"

      "Body": "<p>As we saw at Denge previously, the Covid pandemic has impacted the amount of biodiversity work that could be done over the last year, but the team have still made good progress.<\/p>\n\n<p>In particular, two areas were restored during 2020. This includes a large section of land close to the eastern site boundary and also a section near the weighbridge, just north west of the lake. Both areas will regenerate naturally \u2013 the smaller area near the weighbridge has had brash from heather cutting spread on it to encourage lowland dry heath growth. Some work along the southern boundary was also carried out, to cut heather and remove gorse bushes to prevent succession to scrub.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both of these areas are expected to become lowland dry heath and or lowland acid grassland habitats. In total, the area of land restored comes to 2.2 hectares. Additionally, contractors treated invasive weeds on site, which was successful; only minimal amounts of ragwort are now present.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over the last year, the team at West Heath have spotted 177 species, with animals including roe deer and badgers, birds such as sand martins, skylark and linnet, as well as rarer nightjar and woodcock birds. Egyptian geese (pictured), mute swan, greylag and canada geese are also frequent visitors.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the year ahead, priorities include monitoring for reptiles alongside ecologists; last year adders, grass snakes, slow worms and common lizards were spotted and future sights could impact restoration plans. There is a reptile refuge in the middle of the site and restoration will see more of this created.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Last year, there were some issues with sand martins nesting in stockpiles and so plans are in place to create new nesting faces for the birds during 2021.<\/p>\n\n<p>Closer attention will also be paid to the 0.5 hectares of mire which are along the southern and western shores of the lake and periodically under water. This area is used by birds for feeding.<br />\nTogether with the RSPB, the team at West Heath are working hard to provide a wide range of different habitats for wildlife. We look forward to seeing how the site develops this year!<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

After being sorted according to their origin, these are crushed to produce recycled aggregates which are offered for sale locally or can be fed back into concrete manufacture.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, non-recyclable inert waste is reused to restore quarries for nature conservation and beneficial after use, or transported via approved channels depending on its nature. Wherever possible, CEMEX France uses waterways for transport to reduce its CO2 emissions, in accordance with its Future in Action programme.<br />\nThe Gennevilliers platform is an integral part of CEMEX's strategy to develop a range of urbanisation solutions. Alain Plantier, Director of Materials France North, explains: \"Developing construction in high-growth urban locations requires circular economy solutions which mitigate climate change and save natural resources while improving the wellbeing of inhabitants.\"&nbsp;<br />\n\"CEMEX is uniquely positioned to provide integrated solutions for building and maintaining more sustainable and resilient cities, and this new site demonstrates this perfectly. Clients in Paris need low carbon construction solutions which perform throughout their life cycle. Working together with our clients this site will help to reduce the carbon footprint of new projects in line with CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action strategy \u2013 committed to net zero CO2.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\nThe CEMEX Gennevilliers operation will provide the Paris construction market with a variety of aggregates and concrete, both natural and recycled, including concrete made from recycled aggregates, and with lower transport distances. It will also supply the low and net zero carbon Vertua® concrete range.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, the Gennevilliers platform, which will be ISO 14001 certified this year, meets all of CEMEX's environmental and safety standards, and will soon be certified as required for the port improvement charter, UNICEM CSR label, and Biodiversity commitment.&nbsp;<br />\nAlain Plantier concludes: \"This model, which is the first multi-activity platform of its kind, could be reproduced elsewhere to future needs - the Gennevilliers model is the starting point for a new era for our businesses.\"<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

      "Display Title": "CEMEX contributes low carbon solutions to the spectacular architecture of the Paris Duo Towers",
      "Body": "<p>The towers reach 180m high and 39 floors for the first, and 125 m and 28 floors for the second. For this spectacular achievement, CEMEX delivered more than 40,000 m3 of concrete, including low carbon formulations, and removed 42,000 tonnes or spoil materials via its multimodal transport network.<br />\nThese multi-use skyscrapers presented huge technical challenges to the construction team as they are inclined at an angle of 5° (more than the leaning tower of Pisa) and were built on a very narrow site. The foundations, diaphragm walls and nine basement levels required specialist concrete to enable long six-hour pours and high-quality facings.<br />\nOf the 40,000 m3 of ready-mixed concrete supplied from local CEMEX units, 25% was for concrete foundations for diaphragm walls, and 75% for civil engineering and architectural concrete for elevations. The client also required high-performance concrete for pouring a mega-beam supporting all the towers and with an integrated cooling system. The latter was &nbsp; designed and delivered by the Paris Port-Victor production unit. All the concrete was designed with formulations to reduce the building's carbon footprint, in particular for the foundations.&nbsp;<br />\nIn 2021, 150 m3 of black decorative concrete was pumped for the construction of the terraces of the two towers, while fast-drying anhydrite screed was installed on nearly 2,000 m² of heated floors. In addition, during these three years, thanks to its robust multimodal logistics system, CEMEX will have evacuated almost all of the spoil - nearly 42,000 tonnes.<br />\nThe strong commitment of CEMEX's technical teams ensured the success of the operation. For a complex project like this, excellent communication between the various CEMEX departments (commercial, technical, production) and the concrete manufacturing teams enabled smooth and consistent concrete deliveries during long days and weekends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

These new additions, which are expected to be completed by 2023, include 5 million metric tons of cement capacity in Mexico; 1 million in Europe; 2.3 million in South, Central America and the Caribbean region; and 1.5 million in the Philippines. These additions will be structured to take into consideration the company´s climate action priority.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am pleased to announce that CEMEX is reaching its long-standing goal of an investment-grade capital structure by the end of this month\u201d said Fernando A.

The development of carbon capture technology to make it more accessible and efficient would be an unprecedented achievement for the cement sector.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2020, CEMEX Ventures signed an agreement with Carbon Clean, which allowed CEMEX Ventures and Carbon Clean to outline a roadmap for jointly developing and implementing carbon capture technologies across cement operations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over the last 5 years, Carbon Clean has developed a novel technology (CycloneCC), which can effectively and cost-efficiently capture CO2 from industrial processes. The goal of this breakthrough scalable modular technology is to provide carbon capture at a 10 times smaller installation footprint and 6 times shorter build time, adding up to 50% savings in capital expenditures associated with carbon capture. Additionally, the technology would target operating expenditures as low as US$30 per metric ton of CO2 at an industrial scale.<\/p>\n\n<p>This investment by CEMEX Ventures, along with previously announced investors Equinor Ventures, ICOS Capital, and WAVE Equity Partners, brings the total capital raised by Carbon Clean in the last year to US$30 million.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under its Future in Action program, CEMEX recently announced a new, more aggressive climate action target, to be below 475 kg CO2 per metric ton, an approximate &gt;40% reduction in CO2 emissions, by 2030. This new goal is aligned to the Well Below Two Degree scenario of the Science Based Target initiative (\u201cSBTi). CEMEX is bringing forward its previous 2030 carbon goal of 520 kg of CO2 per metric ton, equivalent to a 35% reduction in emissions, by 5 years to 2025.

It is increasingly costly to dispose of pallet waste and there is far greater value to be gained by recycling and reuse.

The two key objectives of the Bank Station Capacity Upgrade project are to increase capacity at the station and minimise journey times. More than 1200m of new tunnels have already been built, including three new escalator barrels.<br />\nCEMEX was contracted to provide high quality primary lining spray concrete for use in the construction of shafts, tunnels and cross passages, with four 100 tonne silos on site for storage.

However, there are still many pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users using the area at all times, which present a considerable risk that must be closely managed. CEMEX worked closely with Dragados to design a site layout which enabled regular delivery of dry silo materials while minimising disruption to the traffic or pedestrians.<br />\nThe project requires strategic management and coordination by CEMEX\u2019s plant, silo, supply chain and booking teams to ensure product is produced and delivered safely and to schedule.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, the mix supplied is extremely complicated, consisting of eight separate constituents which when combined give strength of +60N/mm2, consistence of 600mm flow and a workability retention of two hours. This mix has been used on several high-profile London projects over the last seven years including the Northern Line Extension and Thames Tideway.<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, commented: \u201cSupplying the Bank station development has presented considerable challenges, particularly around access, but we are very proud of the dedication of our team to ensuring the specific mix of concrete was produced and safely delivered to meet the customer\u2019s requirements.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cIt is a privilege to be part of such a major construction project in our capital city and the spray concrete we have created has become renowned across the industry for its high quality and exceptional finish.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX manufactures the product at a dedicated spray concrete plant from where it is transported into central London.

Reducing net CO2 emissions per ton of cement by 21.6% and avoiding the generation of almost eight million tons of CO2 during 2018 compared with the company\u2019s 1990 baseline. We have a target to further reduce our emissions by 30% by 2030, in line with the science-base targets methodology for our sector.<\/li>\n\t<li>The restoration and conservation of biodiversity in its operations. Storing 23.5 million tons of CO2 naturally in its quarries, of which 96% had a current environmental rehabilitation plan in place at year-end 2018.<\/li>\n\t<li>The management and protection of El Carmen Nature Reserve. This extensive over 140,000-hectare wildlife preserve, equivalent to the size of Mexico City or Houston, Texas, captures around 11 million tons of CO2 naturally in its plant mass.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you want to know more about the latest edition of CEMEX Nature and Conservation&nbsp;Book Series, \u201cNature's Solutions to Climate Change,\u201d please visit the following link:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cemexnature.com/libro/natures-solutions-to-climate-change/\">http://www.cemexnature.com/libro/natures-solutions-to-climate-change/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Participants Information<br />\nConservation International uses science, policy, and partnerships to protect the nature that people rely on for food, fresh water, and livelihoods.

      "Body": "<p>Well although that does make wildlife more visible, the truth is we have a lot more Robins in the UK in the winter. Robins from central Europe migrate here because we have a warmer/milder winter than Europe\u2019s continental climate.<br />\nLots of birds visit here for our island winter climate; Redwings, Fieldfare and Brambling which nest in Norway, Scandinavia and the Arctic move south to us for warmer winters. The particularly tame Waxwings are another arctic circle breeder and winter visitor and their love of berries mean they are often seen at shopping centre carparks on trees; rowan or hawthorn and holly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many of our quarry staff will have seen influx of geese and ducks this time of year too; Pink feet, Pintail, Widgeon, Goldeneye, Goosander, all breed in the arctic and come to the UK for the milder weather. They often spend an hour or two on a quarry pond or in a restored wetland before moving off to the coast to feed on salt marsh and coastal farmland. These birds spend the winter moving between estuaries in the east and west, traveling from The Wash to the Forth of Firth and always flying in that classic aerodynamic V formation.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nImage credit: Tim Melling<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

Sean Cassidy and colleagues will soon be getting on with the job of monitoring wildlife as required by the Biodiversity Action Plans.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sean explains: \u201cWe get a lot of help from CEMEX staff, the RSPB, several NGOs (e.g. Butterfly Conservation, Wildlife Trusts) and visitors to our sites. We are very grateful for the help and enthusiasm we\u2019ve received over the last year. I have prepared a summary of 2019 which was another good year. &nbsp;This subject is becoming more important for the business because of changes to UK law requiring Biodiversity Net Gain and also because it links to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2019 Summary:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>69 species of birds on the red or amber lists were spotted in our quarries in 2019. Our Twite project at Dove Hole quarry continues to help prevent this species from going extinct in England.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites are also important habitats for insects especially as we don\u2019t use pesticides. Bumblebees were present at all of our sites with BAPs and some rarer solitary bees were also spotted. Some sites found nearly 70 species of insect. Of the UK butterfly species 70% of them were spotted at CEMEX sites during 2019. &nbsp;The rarest find was a Blind Cave Spider in the lesser Garth Cave at Taffs Well quarry \u2013 this spider is an IUCN listed species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites are also home to many mammals. With 14 sites housing badgers, 12 have spotted brown hares and two sites are home to our largest mammals \u2013 red deer. &nbsp;Mammal populations in the UK are in decline so it\u2019s important for our BAPs to focus on projects designed to help them such as the Dormouse \u2013 found at only one of our sites in 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Legally protected amphibians and reptiles are also present at many of our sites. The best site for spotting reptiles is West Heath in Sussex as they\u2019ve created specialist hibernacula and spotted Adders, Grass Snakes, Slow Worms and the Common Lizard.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wildflower diversity at some quarries is exceptional. We have three quarries with over 100 species, these are helped by the presence of pollinators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fungi are regularly spotted at our sites as they need undisturbed land to thrive. They play a vital role in the ecosystem by breaking down biomass and putting nutrients back into the soil.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our BAPs help us create many different types of habitats across our sites and stakeholder engagement is also key to our success. For example, in the summer of 2019 a Butterfly Day at one of our \u2018mothballed\u2019 quarries in Fife, Scotland was held. &nbsp;We worked with the local community and the Scottish Butterfly Conservation Society to spot butterflies. &nbsp;They managed to spot 128 species in all, including wildflowers and 12 species of butterfly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites continue to provide a haven for British wildlife and create important spaces in which we can encourage and support some of the rarest plants and animals.<\/p>"

      "Body": "<p>Keeping happy and healthy both physically and mentally is key to how we bounce back out of this situation, as gradually restrictions are lifted. This is also true of our children - many parents will talk of children having cabin fever - there are well documented connections between spending time outdoors in nature and our feelings of wellbeing.<\/p>\n\n<p>During lockdown lots of people are seeing wildlife in their gardens, many are noticing more about nature locally whilst working from home, either in their gardens or on daily exercise. &nbsp;To encourage this, our partner the RSPB runs a programme called Wild Challenge \u2013 an opportunity for people to connect with the natural world in brave new ways \u2013 to reach out and touch it and meet it head-on, up-close and personal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Three of the leaders from across the UK business took part in the Wild Challenge, and hopefully this will encourage you and your families to participate too! Find out more below\u2026<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve Redwood, Land Development and Permitting Director for Europe, is on lockdown in rural Cambridgeshire with his family \u2013 three boys. Like many others he has been making the most of the weather and helping his children connect with nature on his doorstep for daily lockdown exercise and to fight off cabin fever!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve decided to participate in the RSPB\u2019s Wild Challenge with his youngest son, Harry (eight years old), by combining a birdwatching wildlife walk with sowing wildflowers for bees. They walked around the local farmers\u2019 fields looking for birds, insects and basically anything moving!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve says: \u201cOur walk took us around the local field boundaries; we saw hedge sparrows, a pair of Red Kites who nest in the local woodland being chased by three or four crows and on adjacent lakes we could see a pair of nesting swans. My son was particularly interested in the badger sett we saw by the woodland and discussed why we did not see any badgers during the day. On our way home we walked past a pond and saw a grass snake (well I think it was?) swimming across the pond.<\/p>\n\n<p>At home we sowed some wildflower seeds on a patch of open land in our garden. We used some wildflower seeds bound in clay that you throw on the prepared ground (raked over and watered) - called Beebombs which are great for kids and very easy to sow. We discussed the importance of wildflowers for bees and how important bees are for the countryside, biodiversity and their role in the ecosystems. Adding a nectar corner, full of flowers for bees, butterflies, hoverflies is a really rewarding way to add more colour to the garden and help nature.&nbsp;<br />\nWe had a really enjoyable day and have done a little to help wildlife. We had some quality time together outside, and quite an exciting and interesting afternoon!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, CEMEX Managing Director UK Materials Lex Russell, is on lockdown in Edinburgh with his older son and Lex decided to take part in the RSPB\u2019s Wild Challenge, by looking for Signs of Spring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Lex commented: \u201cThe changes to all of our lives that the COVID pandemic has brought have been unprecedented. &nbsp;My personal situation found me in lockdown in Edinburgh sharing a flat with no garden with my eldest son. The challenges of work during the crisis were some of the most extreme that I have ever endured. Very quickly it became apparent that during lockdown I needed to look after both my physical and mental wellbeing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Working with the RSPB I have developed a great passion for engaging with nature in our quarries and sites, so the \u201cfirst signs of spring\u201d initiative seemed like a good opportunity for me, to let nature help me maintain my overall wellbeing. &nbsp;My highlight is the early morning walks along the Water of Leith listening to the dawn chorus and smelling the aroma of the wildflowers. &nbsp;This gave me the inspiration to deal with all of the challenges I had to face in a working day.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>It can be hard to find green space in the heart of a cities, but parks and communal gardens are a place to start, with rivers sides and canal paths being richer in nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nLex:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listened to the dawn chorus.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listened to a bird in full song.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looked for spring - finding the first flowers.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Found the first trees coming into leaf.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Watched for invertebrates- butterflies and pollinators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, Andy Spencer, VP Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for the EMEAA Region, took part in a Wild Challenge is his back garden \u2013 going on a bug safari!<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy is spending lockdown at home with his family in Leicestershire and taking time out in his garden has given him the opportunity to check in on the two bee and bug hotels he installed a few years ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy says: \u201cThe bee and bug hotels have been a very easy way to encourage more wildlife into our garden \u2013 it was literally just a case of hanging them up on the fence! I installed a couple of them about three years ago, both on a south facing fence at the bottom of the garden, near to a tree and some Laurel bushes.<\/p>\n\n<p>We had to be patient at first but in the second year we started to notice the holes being filled and then in springtime a frenzy of activity during the day. They are now used a lot by solitary bees. One of the bee hotels has different spaces for insects and we have seen lacewings and other insects around it.<br />\nI definitely think we have seen more bees in the garden as a result. Although it is a small garden, we have a few miniature fruit trees and we seem to be getting better pollination and more fruit over the past couple of years. We have also noticed last year and this year several ground nesting bee nests \u2013 and the bees are not aggressive at all so no fear for the kids!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see from these three examples, wherever we are spending lockdown there are still plenty of opportunities to get out and experience nature. &nbsp;If you\u2019d like to take part in your own Wild Challenge, click through the link below:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-families/family-wild-challenge/\">https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-families/family-wild-challenge/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

      "Display Title": "No travel restrictions for the Sand Martins!",
      "Body": "<p>The scientific name of the Sand Martin, Riparia, means \u201criverbank.\u201d With their traditional home being sandy sided riverbanks; so their food consists of small insects, mostly gnats and other flies that are associated with waterways and lakes. However, any steep sided sand bank is potential a nesting site. If you manage a site with sand or even dust piles that attract sand martins, there are two key measures to follow; firstly maintain an area suitable for their nesting with a sheer sand face, away from operational activities, and secondly keep operational sand piles sloped at 45 degrees or less to ensure the sand martins don\u2019t choose working piles as their new nest site.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although sand martins are maintaining a healthy population that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t face several challenges. One of the amazing facts about sand martins is their migration, they winter in east and southern Africa by crossing the Sahara Desert nonstop (as there\u2019s nowhere to feed!). The Sahara is the largest desert in the world, measuring approximately 3,000 miles from east to west and 1,200 miles from north to south. Before crossing the Sahara Desert, the Sand Martins store up just enough fat to keep them going through the journey without needing to refuel. Without enough fat, they won\u2019t have the energy to make the crossing, but if they store too much fat they\u2019ll be weighed down and their flight won\u2019t be efficient. &nbsp;All of this is from a bird that is just 12-14cm long, weighs 13.5g and lives on gnats! Knowing this might bring a little more sympathy and admiration for them when you see the Sand Martins return this spring from their 10,000 mile journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>This species originally nested in the steep, sandy banks of rivers, but have adapted to using many different man-made sites with Sand Martins banks often added to CEMEX sites\u2019 restoration schemes.<\/p>\n\n<p>An example of this can be found at Berkswell Quarry in Quarry. Andy Barber, Quarry Manager at Berkswell Quarry, explains: \u201cWe built a Sand Martin \u2018hotel\u2019 at Berkswell a few years ago, to provide somewhere for the birds to nest while protecting our excavation. It now only requires minimal maintenance each year \u2013 the birds tend to arrive on site from April onwards, so before this we scrape the face of the \u2018hotel\u2019 to make sure it is clean and vertical. As soon as the birds start arriving, we leave it alone. There are around 60 holes on the \u2018hotel\u2019 for the Sand Martins to nest in and generally we see about 50-60 pairs using it each year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re lovely little birds and it\u2019s interesting to watch them return each year \u2013 they often seem to return to the same hole. It\u2019s phenomenal how they create their nests really and its great that they can have a safe haven with us. We should be doing what we can to help the wildlife that uses our sites \u2013 it\u2019s important to get the balance between maintaining habitats and continuing our operations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The birds seem to be returning a little slower this year, perhaps because it is quite cold for April. We always look forward to welcoming them back to our site!\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

The benefit of using brash is that other heath species will also be collected and spread, along with any associated microbes. There are lots of little-understood interactions between plants and microbes, and this method gives the new potential seedlings the best shot at establishing well. &nbsp;Once the brash is scattered you just wait and see.&nbsp;<br />\nHeather potentially germinates twice a year, but the soil pH, weather and moisture conditions need to be right. In the spring following brash scattering we had a late severe snowy cold snap named \u2018beast from the east\u2019 1 and 2 - bringing snow into May. Plus, we\u2019ve had exceptionally dry springs with little or no rain, followed by poor summers and wet winters! Luckily heather seeds last a very long time, (Heather seeds have a half-life of circa 50-60 years i.e. half the seeds are viable for 50-60yrs) some, found at archaeological sites have been known to germinate after a thousand years.&nbsp;<br />\nLast year in 2020 we had started to get very concerned that perhaps there was something wrong at site \u2013 some other reason for the lack of germination, and found that on part of the land some on the deeper subsoils under that\u2019s sandy topsoil we\u2019re not the ideal pH. &nbsp;However, site was always intended to be a heathland mosaic of features and not wall to wall heather so we weren\u2019t too concerned.&nbsp;<br />\nThen last month a site visit brought us all a feeling of Joy\u2026.

      "Body": "<p>The coalition is a partnership between the World Economic Forum and the US Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. It is the only buyers club working to scale new technologies across the heavy industry and heavy-duty transport sectors.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d), roughly half of the emission reductions needed to reach the critical 2050 climate target of keeping the global temperature increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius, when compared to pre-industrial levels, rely on new and emerging technologies. The FMC will create new markets and promote growth by leveraging collective demand and purchasing commitments for zero emission goods and services by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWith its Future in Action program, CEMEX is committed to lead on the road to carbon neutrality. We are proud to join forces with the World Economic Forum and other global companies to accelerate the development of critical new decarbonizing technologies. Our shared goals and the investments announced today would not be possible without the steadfast leadership shown throughout this process by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and the World Economic Forum,\u201d said CEMEX CEO Fernando A. González.<\/p>\n\n<p>The coalition will work across eight key sectors. Seven of these sectors \u2014steel, cement, aluminum, chemicals, shipping, aviation, and trucking\u2014account for more than a third of global carbon emissions, but do not currently have cost-competitive energy alternatives to fossil fuels.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese companies will be critical partners in pushing for commercially viable alternatives to decarbonize these industrial sectors and more,\u201d US President Joe Biden noted during a speech at the \u201cAccelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment\u201d event at COP26 Tuesday.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cTechnology has given us the tools to reduce our emissions and build a stronger and more inclusive economy of the future,\u201d said Børge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum. \u201cFor innovators and investors to play their part in tackling the climate crisis, they need clear market demand. The First Movers Coalition will leverage the collective purchasing power of leading companies and drive the need for these technologies.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Under its Future in Action program, CEMEX has committed to the most aggressive 2030 decarbonization goals in the heavy building materials industry, and its ambition to deliver net zero CO2 concrete globally by 2050. While the program relies on proven technology to reach its 2030 goals, it includes a focus on innovation and partnership to develop and scale the new technologies needed to fully decarbonize the cement and concrete businesses by 2050. Among them are investments in solar fuel pioneer Synhelion, and agreements with Volvo for electro-mobility solutions and BP to collaborate on potential solutions including clean electricity and low carbon fuels and transportation.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to being a founding member of the FMC, CEMEX has joined the United Nation\u2019s Race to Zero campaign and the Business Ambition for 1.5°C coalition.

      "Body": "<p>Based in the UK, Carbon8 Systems is a leader in the permanent capture of CO2 and mineralization of thermal residues to create carbon-infused, sustainable products. The company developed a patented chemical process called Accelerated Carbonation Technology (\"ACT\") where industrial residues are treated with captured CO2 emissions to transform them into valuable, low-carbon products.<\/p>\n\n<p>ACT has made significant contributions to the circular economy for more than 10 years, delivering commercial and environmental benefits that include diverting waste from landfills, permanently capturing CO2 and replacing carbon-intensive products with low-carbon, sustainable alternatives. ACT is applied to several industries, including cement, waste to energy, biomass, among others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both CEMEX and Carbon8 Systems recognize the benefit of mineralization as a carbon sink. Therefore, they may explore the application of the technology to different byproducts as well as the manufacturing of products such as alternative aggregates and supplementary cementitious materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under the initiative, Carbon8 Systems will evaluate CEMEX byproducts and how they can be used to develop low-carbon or even carbon-negative products through ACT. The initial focus of the program will be to assess byproducts from CEMEX's Rüdersdorf cement plant in Germany and Rugby cement plant in the UK. They will also evaluate the suitability of a lightweight aggregate product created from the byproducts for sale in each market. The program could later be deployed to other CEMEX cement sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"This initiative with Carbon8 Systems is another example of the work we are doing with partners across industries, academia, and startups to tap into the latest innovation and disruptive technologies to achieve our ambition of delivering net-zero CO2 concrete globally to all of our customers,\" said Juan Romero, Executive Vice President Sustainability, Commercial, and Operations Development of CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>John Pilkington, Chief Executive of Carbon8 Systems, said: \u201cWe are delighted that CEMEX has asked us to work with them; our carbonation technology, demonstrated at cement plants in Europe and Canada, offers CEMEX and the global cement industry a proven CCUS solution.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>This effort is part of CEMEX's roadmap for its ambitious climate action goals, including delivering globally net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050.

This process occurs naturally under atmospheric conditions. If left in the open, compounds such as calcium or magnesium oxides, hydroxides, or silicates will react with the carbon dioxide. However, in nature, this process takes millennia. C8S\u2019 technology accelerates this process in a controlled way and in doing so, has created one of the worlds few economically-viable forms of carbonation and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU). The ACT process mineralises and stabilises these industrial by-products or residues to produce a granular solid. C8S\u2019 expertise around the carbonation process means that it is able to control the physical characteristics of the end-product. The end-product has various valuable applications, such as aggregates for construction, or agricultural fertiliser.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CO2ntainer system (a modular, containerised solution \u2013 carbon capture in a box) is similar in size to a shipping container so can be easily transported by HGV to site.<\/p>\n\n<p>John Pilkington has held a number of non-executive director roles and was previously a director of Ove Arup &amp; Partners and then Carillion plc and Amey plc for over 30 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2017, the company was awarded the Queens Award for Enterprise \u2013 Innovation, and its work has received support from Innovate UK and the State of Ontario in Canada.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"www.c8s.co.uk\">www.c8s.co.uk<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Its goal is to inspire a new meaning for the role of CFOs as the architects of long- term sustainable value creation by raising awareness of the transformative impact of corporate finance across financial markets, the global economy and society as a whole. It also aspires to create a market for corporate SDG investments and finance that is sufficiently diverse and transparent to channel trillions of dollars of financial investments towards effective private-sector solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals. The CFO Taskforce provides CFOs with a platform to share ideas, develop new concepts and frameworks, and provide recommendations to unlock private capital and create a market for mainstream SDG investments.

      "Body": "<p>CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (\u201cCEMEX\u201d) and COBOD International (\u201cCOBOD\u201d), a global leader in construction-grade 3D printers, announced today the introduction of a 3D printing solution that utilizes conventional ready-mix concrete in the building process. The solution allows for a reduction in time and significant savings versus traditional construction and other 3D printing methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>Utilizing an innovative admixture, CEMEX and COBOD developed a solution for 3D printing that enables the use of conventional concrete, allowing the consumption of local and readily available materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current 3D printing methods rely on highly specialized and expensive mortars. CEMEX introduced a proprietary admixtures family called D.fab, which transforms conventional concrete into a versatile material that can be efficiently tailored for 3D printing construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>This admixtures innovation produces a more fluid and malleable concrete that facilitates the pouring process for 3D printing applications. COBOD\u2019s printers and expertise, in combination with the admixtures, make it possible for the concrete to gain shape instantaneously. COBOD applied the new solution for the first time in a suburb of Luanda, the capital of Angola, where homebuilder Power2Build used it to construct Angola\u2019s first 3D printed concrete house.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe introduction of this revolutionary 3D printing system is a testament to our customer-centric mindset and relentless focus on continuous innovation and improvement. Working together with COBOD, we have developed an experience for customers that is superior to anything that has been provided in the past,\u201d said Juan Romero, Executive Vice President Sustainability, Commercial, and Operations Development of CEMEX. \u201cOur innovation efforts position us at the forefront of new technologies that contribute to building a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo address the world´s affordable housing needs requires not only a technology that can build faster, but also materials that are as economical as ordinary concrete. With this solution, the strength and quality of concrete combined with the speed and automation of 3D printing, we can help solve the affordable housing crisis in Angola and elsewhere,\u201d said Ricardo Almeida, CEO of Power2Build.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cCOBOD began 3D construction printing back in 2017, and 3D printed Europe\u2019s first 3D printed building, we made the concrete recipe ourselves. We had to use much cement to get the material to work, with the consequence that our recipe was not as efficient as we aspired. However, we continued to look for a solution with ordinary concrete, which is critical for the mass application of our technology. We are more than pleased that CEMEX took on the challenge and proud that we cooperated to develop the new solution,\u201d said Henrik Lund-Nielsen, Founder &amp; General Manager of COBOD International.<\/p>\n\n<p>About COBOD<br />\nCOBOD International A/S, Denmark, is a construction robotics and automation company in hypergrowth with +70 employees. We are globally the leading supplier of 3D construction printers and technology. It is our mission to disrupt the construction industry on a global scale by lowering the cost of construction via robotics and automation. We made Europe\u2019s first 3D printed building in 2017 and since then our printers have been used to create Europe\u2019s first two- and three-story buildings in Belgium and Germany, the first villa in Dubai and the first 3D printed buildings in Africa.

In a few hours, seven teams of five to six volunteers managed to break the daily harvesting record with 1,162 kg of olives harvested. Almost 6.5 tonnes of olives were collected, from which 900 litres of eco-certified extra virgin olive oil will be produced. CEMEX also involved students from two local community primary schools to help with the olive harvest.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, restored quarries in CEMEX\u2019s Spanish operation provided additional examples of successful horticulture and environmental enrichment from productive restoration. The former \u2018El Clotet\u2019 quarry in Alicante, Spain, is now a 138-hectare agricultural holding with more than 55,000 fruit trees. The farm has started to collect more than 2,000 tonnes of citrus fruits for the national and export market, beginning in October and running until May.<br />\nRafael Sempere, head of CEMEX's agricultural division in Spain, explained: \u201cThis restored quarry is an example of a sustainable, environmentally friendly farm that uses the latest irrigation techniques to avoid wasting a single drop of water, a very valuable resource in Spain.\u201d<br />\nAnother pioneering project is CEMEX\u2019s vineyard, located in the former quarry of the Yepes cement factory near Toledo. Thirty hectares of land and 92,000 plants of the best grape varieties are cultivated in a restored natural environment. The production of grapes and wine from this site demonstrates how properly restored industrial land can provide agricultural production of benefit to both the local community and the natural habitat.<br />\nAndrew Spencer, VP of Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX EMEA added: \u201cWe recognise that our industry has consequences for the environment, but CEMEX is working hard to actively counteract climate change and this drive is present through all aspects of our business.

This has been a fantastic experience having previously struggled to find sea time to complete my training due to COVID-19. As the months passed, it looked less and less likely that I would be able qualify in the next few years, despite having completed my Foundation Degree in Marine Engineering at nautical college. However, through my mentor from the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, Captain Matt Bland, I had the opportunity to join this vessel and complete my training.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the early stages of my cadetship I spent some time on a deep-sea containership. Although I found this interesting, it was not necessarily a good learning environment. In comparison, CEMEX UK Marine has been an excellent organisation in which to learn my trade. Not only have I made good progress on the completion of my Training Record Book, but the crew have been actively willing to teach me in a way I haven\u2019t encountered before.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, I think this vessel is an excellent learning environment for cadets. In a matter of weeks I have experienced a variety of engine room maintenance procedures, emergency drills, maintenance on deck machinery and even observed some bridge operations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I have been impressed with the procedures at CEMEX, which create a safe environment to work in. I have also had the chance to assist in the completion of crucial documentation including Permits to Work and Lock-Out paperwork under the supervision of the Chief Engineer. Having not come across the important initiatives like \u201cStep In\u201d, Near-Miss Hazard Alert Cards and Work Safe Risk Assessments on a vessel before, I can see how these contribute to the excellent safety culture at CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would like to give thanks to Matt, the Officers and Crew, and CEMEX UK for this fantastic opportunity.

One in six young driver will become involved in a crash within their first two years of driving. This is of great concern to the local authorities, emergency services and most certainly to parents of young drivers and vulnerable road users. To this end, CEMEX SDSA Warwickshire is designed to address these issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>SDSA is fast paced, balancing educational content with real life evidence, factually presented, holding the audience\u2019s attention throughout. It uses testimonies from officers in the emergency services about their real experiences in dealing with the aftermath of serious road crashes; from crash survivors and the bereaved. It also covers Safer and Healthy Mobility, a new section on other forms of transportation used by young people.<\/p>\n\n<p>This year\u2019s event was organised by Rugby resident George Atkinson, a road safety campaigner since his daughter was killed as a pedestrian in London in 1998. George would like to thank CEMEX for their sponsorship and Rugby School for allowing their students to witness this life saving road safety show.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"CEMEX is committed to protecting the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable road users and we feel very honoured to sponsor this year\u2019s Safe Drive Stay Alive event, an impactful and important show that could help to save lives. We recognise the vulnerability of new and young drivers and we hope that this programme will go a long way in influencing the behaviours which can lead to a generation of risk averse drivers.\"<br />\n<strong>Chiedza Mupfumira, Social Impact Specialist for CEMEX UK<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\"It is always a privilege to support George and Giulietta in their tireless and effective campaigning for greater road safety.

      "Summary": "CEMEX has introduced CEMEX ONPOINT, a new range of durable, coloured cement mortars, specially designed for the off-site and urban architectural specification markets.",

      "Display Title": "New CEMEX ONPOINT Mortar Injects Colour into Offsite Construction and Urban Building Design",
      "Body": "<p>Developed to complement and enhance the design and aesthetics of any architectural or urban scheme, CEMEX ONPOINT is a factory-produced mortar available in over 35 consistent colour palette options, effectively complementing a wide range of masonry products and existing mortar. Guaranteed to not fade and providing high levels of resistance in extreme exposure, CEMEX ONPOINT is suitable for multi-use applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This new product is ideal for offsite and precast panel construction for commercial development, modular housing and residential high rise, as well as for restoration and retrofit projects. The high performance mortar is formulated for gun injection application, providing an additional sustainability benefit by reducing waste and labour costs. It allows quick and efficient pointing of brick inlay systems and brick slip panels, and is equally effective for matching and repointing existing brickwork. Offsite production is seen by many as a more sustainable method of construction because everything is made under strict factory conditions, allowing optimisation of the process and the most efficient use of materials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Mike May, Sales Manager for Mortars Europe, comments: \u201cWe\u2019re continuously looking at how we can enhance the performance, durability and consistency of our mortars to meet market demand. The off-site market is booming, but precast manufacturers and architectural specifiers are limited in their choice of mortars. The arrival of CEMEX ONPOINT now enables precast manufacturers and specialist designers the ability to dramatically enhance aesthetics and increase the kerb appeal of their buildings via quick and easy gun injction application, which also cuts down on wasted material.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur wide range of colours also make CEMEX ONPOINT the ideal mortar to support sustainable retrofit and restoration. On heritage projects we can now accurately colour-match existing mortars for repointing and maintenance work. Our existing buildings account for more than 35% of the world\u2019s energy consumption, so solutions like CEMEX ONPOINT can significantly contribute to a more efficient built environment and a better future for all.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>All CEMEX Mortars comply with the requirements of BS EN 998-2 and the complete range of masonry mortars have been verified against a prescribed range of initial type tests such as durability, bond strength, fire protection and strength criteria.<\/p>\n\n<p>ONPOINT is the latest addition to CEMEX\u2019s broader Urbanisation Solutions business, which is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on the Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/onpoint-coloured-pointing-mortar\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/onpoint-coloured-pointing-mortar<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Restoration using on-site materials will be completed progressively to agricultural land, with biodiversity enhancements and community benefits over a further year or so depending upon seasons.

Additionally, the supply of materials provides jobs in the wider community in construction and building and there are also opportunities for the continuity of job opportunities connected to the Ripple East proposals.&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">The site is currently in arable use and is of low ecological value.&nbsp; Restoration will include the reinstatement of high-quality agricultural land as well as a mosaic of new and enhanced habitats identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, together with increased flood attenuation capacity provided by the new lakes. There is potential to incorporate a community orchard and a new section of footpath to link within the existing rights of way network.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">We recognise the impact that developments of this nature may cause, and we will always seek to minimise this as much as possible. The planning application submitted by CEMEX is supported by an Environmental Impact Assessment.

They support steel rails specifically where they cross over junctions and crossing, and are widely known as S&amp;C Switches and Crossings concrete. &nbsp;Each bearer is unique from the next, having different angled shoulders and anchor point inserts, different fixture points depending on the angle of the rail crossing over it, and different lengths. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The bearers supplied for Uddingston were between 2.6m and 8.5m which is something that Somercotes have produced for many years, however, for the Uddingston project the longer sections were a first of their kind using the new design, NR60 MKII \u2013 an added complexity to the project! The customer needed these bearers split into three sections allowing for smaller panel sizes. Once delivered, the bearers would be bolted together during assembly process at site. This made the job more complex than a standard installation since shrinkage factors over three-part units had to be calculated to ensure that a rail seat was within 1mm and that a track to track is within 1.5mm. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The innovative NR60 MKII design incorporates a recess cast into the concrete, to anchor a plastic angled rail foot on top of which the steel rail sits. This foot enables the rail to be inclined, allowing trains to run through smoother, resulting in less movement of bearers and ballast and therefore less maintenance time on track. The design\u2019s recess also allows for less torque on the concrete as the forces are against the recess rather than against a steel shoulder. It was imperative that all anchor points within the concrete were at the correct position, correct axis, correct angle and all within 1mm of tolerance.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Terence Clair commented: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my team who played a critical part in this project.&nbsp;CEMEX UK Rail Solutions created complex concrete to tight timelines putting our customers at the centre of all we are.

Operations Manager, Terence Clair, attended many calls with lead designers, Network Rail Project teams and Network Rail\u2019s Route Service team. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The Somercotes team dealt with changing configurations in design, bearer length requirements and many other challenges but under very tight timescales \u2013 they successfully delivered the bearers to the assemblers, ready for installation on site over Christmas 2021. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Concrete bearers are pre-stressed concrete. They support steel rails specifically where they cross over junctions and crossing, and are widely known as S&amp;C Switches and Crossings concrete. &nbsp;Each bearer is unique from the next, having different angled shoulders and anchor point inserts, different fixture points depending on the angle of the rail crossing over it, and different lengths. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The bearers supplied for Uddingston were between 2.6m and 8.5m which is something that Somercotes have produced for many years, however, for the Uddingston project the longer sections were a first of their kind using the new design, NR60 MKII \u2013 an added complexity to the project! The customer needed these bearers split into three sections allowing for smaller panel sizes. Once delivered, the bearers would be bolted together during assembly process at site. This made the job more complex than a standard installation since shrinkage factors over three-part units had to be calculated to ensure that a rail seat was within 1mm and that a track to track is within 1.5mm. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The innovative NR60 MKII design incorporates a recess cast into the concrete, to anchor a plastic angled rail foot on top of which the steel rail sits. This foot enables the rail to be inclined, allowing trains to run through smoother, resulting in less movement of bearers and ballast and therefore less maintenance time on track. The design\u2019s recess also allows for less torque on the concrete as the forces are against the recess rather than against a steel shoulder. It was imperative that all anchor points within the concrete were at the correct position, correct axis, correct angle and all within 1mm of tolerance.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Terence Clair commented: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my team who played a critical part in this project.&nbsp;CEMEX UK Rail Solutions created complex concrete to tight timelines putting our customers at the centre of all we are. Great work by all the installation team, well done!\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>"

These products can be used together for pavements constructed with clay, natural stone or concrete pavers.<br />\nSTREETPAVE PaveBase bedding mortar is made from cement and graded aggregates, and is available in a silo, bulk and 25kg bags. Once applied it is highly durable, suitable for walking on in 12 hours and driving on in 24 hours, and can be laid from 10-75mm in one pass. It is perfect for paved areas of mixed foot and vehicular traffic alongside general private and public hardscape areas.<br />\nMeanwhile, STREETPAVE PaveGrip priming slurry uses specially selected aggregates to create the essential bond between the bedding and the paving element. Delivered in bulk or 25kg bag, it is applied with a brush at 1-2mm thick and is suitable for high-trafficked pavement.<br />\nSTREETPAVE PaveFill flowing joining mortar is the final step in this premium quality system. It is fast-setting and frost resistant with a 40MPa compressive strength and low shrinkage. Simple to mix and apply, PaveFill can be applied in joint widths of 5-50mm and up to 200mm deep in a single pass.<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, commented: \u201cCEMEX is a UK leader in specialist mortar systems for hard landscaping and our new STREETPAVE system is a further demonstration of our expertise; allowing our customers to construct resilient pavements that meet and exceed the strict demands of BS 7533.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe STREETPAVE system has been designed so it can work as a three-stage process with each product tested individually and collectively.
