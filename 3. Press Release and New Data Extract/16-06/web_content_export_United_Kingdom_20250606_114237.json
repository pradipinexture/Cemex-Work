The desk was conceived in partnership with CEMEX and incorporates cutting edge developments in concrete.<\/p> <p>\u201cWe have recently moved into new offices at the White Collar Factory, a cutting edge office building in terms of its approach to sustainability and modern office design. There is a lot of exposed concrete, polished finished pillars and timber slats in formwork showing exemplar work in traditional concrete construction approaches. <br> <br> \u201cWithin these surroundings we wanted visitors to get a feeling of innovation, experimental, and cutting edge material use, reflecting our approach to design, combining tradition with innovation to maximise a material\u2019s potential. <\/p> <p>\u201cThe reception desk showcases what high performance concrete can do and how fabric formwork can be used in shape generation and high quality exposed finishes- it combines function, innovation in material and fabrication and performance as a traditional desk space. It\u2019s a working area but a stylish working area,\u201d comments Ed Moseley, Design Director AKTII. <br> <br> The project originated after executives from AKT II were introduced to the concrete technology developed by the CEMEX Global R&D team, located in Switzerland. The inspiration behind the co-created design of the desk, was drawn from the versatility and malleability of the material, together with the modern ambience already set in the AKT II offices. <\/p> <p>\u201cCollaborating with AKT II on this project, gave us the opportunity to push the boundaries of the innovative technologies we have been developing. We were able to present concrete in a new light and explore new fabrication techniques that, when combined together, produced an element in which one would not expect to find such material,\u201d stated Davide Zampini, Head of CEMEX Global R&D.<br> <br> The reception desk uses ultra-high-performance concrete with fibre reinforcement which enables it to have fluid curves and embedded texture. Lightweight concrete and water-repellent technology were also used in the creation of the desk. <br> <br> This everyday piece of furniture makes a unique statement and highlights the amazing possibilities of the world\u2019s most consumed manmade product. <\/p> <p>AKTII is a London-based firm of structural and civil engineering consultants. CEMEX R&D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland. <\/p> <p>-Ends-<br> <br> For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a>Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t: 01932 583214. <\/p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li>More high resolution photographs of different aspects of the reception desk are available<\/li><li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/li><li><strong>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 <\/strong>CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.<\/li><li><strong>About CEMEX: <\/strong>CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

The demanding target of 1000 hectares was set for the year 2020, but has just been reached with the 1000<sup>th<\/sup> hectare created at Hopwas Quarry, near Tamworth in the West Midlands. 　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Andy Spencer, Director of Sustainability, CEMEX UK comments: \u201cThe partnership with the RSPB has enabled us to enhance the natural environment surrounding our operations. While supplying our customers with concrete, cement, sand and stone we also aim to balance the needs of operations with the protection and enhancement of the natural world. The RSPB has been pivotal in helping us achieve this aim. 　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">\u201cThe 1000<sup>th<\/sup> hectare that has just been created is a significant and outstanding milestone and our partnership to date has helped create some amazing places for communities and nature,\u201d he concludes.　<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">This is endorsed by Mike Clarke, Chief Executive RSPB \u201cOur nature is in trouble and we need to be creating habitats to reverse the population declines we have seen in many species, some of which are in danger of disappearing entirely.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">\u201cWorking in partnership with CEMEX we have seen how land can be transformed from being an operational site or exhausted quarry into a vibrant home for wildlife. These new much needed habitats are attracting and becoming home to wildlife including threatened species. They are also offering fantastic amenities for local communities and nature lovers. 　<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">\u201cThe successes we are seeing are great examples of how conservationists and businesses can come together to create something special for wildlife and future generations to enjoy.\u201d　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">The 1000<sup>th<\/sup> hectare was created at Hopwas quarry, an exhausted sand and gravel quarry. Heather cuttings containing seeds and other flora from an adjoining Site of Scientific Interest (SSSI) site has been spread over part of the site.  This will encourage and help create heathland, typical of the surrounding area.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">The first hectare to benefit from the partnership in 2010 was Eversley Quarry in Hampshire where, over the years, a mosaic of different habitats has been created alongside community sports facilities.  The latest project includes the creation of reed beds to encourage Bitterns, which currently have a small population of around 80 breeding pairs in the UK.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Other quarry sites that have made a significant contribution to nature include Southam in Warwickshire with a dedicated area of sparse wasteland for the Small Blue Butterfly, Dove Holes in Derbyshire where a meadow has been planted with a flower rich mix including sorrel for the Twite bird and Cambusmore in Scotland, with its rich grasslands and open waters, the perfect environment for wildfowl and birds of prey.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">-Ends-　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\"> <\/p>\n<b><p dir=\"LTR\">Notes to editors:　<\/p>\n<\/b><p dir=\"LTR\">For further CEMEX information contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/span><\/a> t: 01932 583214 　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">For further RSPB information contact Gareth Brede, RSPB senior media officer: 01767 693221 / <a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">gareth.brede@rspb.org.uk<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<ul><li dir=\"LTR\">\u201cThe story of the 1000 hectares\u201d video can be found on YouTube http://cmx.to/2xXPcw1　\n<\/li><li dir=\"LTR\">More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website <a href=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">www.cemex.co.uk<\/span><\/a>\n<\/li><li dir=\"LTR\">Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.

Three nest holes have been seen in the quarry\u2019s sandy bank.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Yesterday afternoon (19 July) RSPB wardens watching the nests noticed parent birds flying to and from one of the nest holes with food, indicating that young were being fed. The other two nests are now also on the verge of hatching and the RSPB expects all three will have young by the weekend. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Bee-eaters are rare visitors to the UK. Before the Millennium they had only appeared twice, but have since nested in Cumbria (2015), the Isle of Wight (2014), Herefordshire (2005) and Country Durham (2002). It is thought they are expanding their range north due to climate change.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Mark Thomas, RSPB Senior Investigations Officer, said: \u201cThese exotic birds \u2013 a kaleidoscope of greens, yellows, reds and blues \u2013 are much more likely to be seen in southern Europe or Africa rather than Nottinghamshire. But we\u2019re delighted to see bee-eaters return to nest in the UK once more; a very rare occurrence that has wildlife enthusiasts very excited.\u201d <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Around 10,000 people are thought to have seen the Nottinghamshire bee-eaters, some travelling from as far afield as Cornwall and County Durham.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As their name suggests, bee-eaters feed predominately on bees and other flying insects like wasps and dragonflies. After catching a bee, the birds will toss it into the air or strike the bee against a branch to remove the string, rendering it safe to swallow.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Mark added: \u201cBee-eaters are sociable birds and nest together in small groups. Often pairs will enlist the help of a single, younger bird to help bring food and rear their chicks. Bringing up baby is very much a community effort.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cIn recent years, bee-eater sightings have been on the increase. We believe the birds are being pushed northwards due to climate change, so are likely to become more established visitors to the UK in the future. And, thanks to this partnership with CEMEX, we can provide that right habitat for them.\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Bee-eaters and nest in burrows that reach up to 10ft (3m) often in sand banks, in which they lay 3-8 white eggs. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Andy Spencer, Sustainability Director at CEMEX, said: \u201cWorking quarries like this one offer the perfect home for bee-eaters and other birds like sand martins. On CEMEX quarry sites we build dedicated sand piles away from the operations where birds can make their nests and breed without interruption. We\u2019re delighted to be hosting these charming visitors for the duration of their stay in the UK.\"  <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Because the birds are so rare, round-the-clock protection was necessary to ensure the birds and their nests were not disturbed. Working closely with CEMEX, the RSPB deployed wardens to monitor the site day and night to ensure the safety of both birds and birdwatchers. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Mark Thomas explained: \u201cBy day, the nests were at risk from egg collectors, and by night the eggs \u2013 and now the chicks \u2013 are at risk of being taken by a fox. Fox prints were seen in the sand, so we posted wardens armed with torches on night watch to deter any predators that might be on the prowl. Sure enough, one night, a fox appeared near the nests, but was scared away by the torchlight. If we hadn\u2019t been present, it would almost certainly have got the chicks.\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The nestlings are expected to fledge around mid-August, giving birdwatchers a chance to see them before the colony flies back to their southern territories.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>To visit the bee-eaters, go to Ashby Road, East Leake, Notts LE12 6RG.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>More: <\/p><p><ahref=\"https:>https://www.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/biodiversity/archive/2017/06/26/how-to-see-bee-eaters-in-nottinghamshire.aspx<\/ahref=\"https:><\/p><p> <\/p><p> -Ends-<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young on 01932 583214 or email <\/p><p><a>Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a><\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Photographs, video and interviews:<\/p><p> <\/p><p>For further images, video or to arrange an ISDN broadcast-quality radio interview please contact Harry Bellew, RSPB.<\/p><p>Image Credit: Jeff Rose <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Editor\u2019s notes:<\/p><p> <\/p>The RSPB is the UK\u2019s largest nature conservation charity, inspiring everyone to give nature a home.

        "Body": "<p>Three new islands have been created for wetland and wading birds out of the ash surplus from nearby South Ferriby cement plant, close to the Humber. It is hoped that over 5000 birds will enjoy the moonscape-like surface of the small, but perfectly formed islands.<\/p> <p>The islands have been created in the alkaline lake on land adjoining the cement plant using ash from the cement making process.  This environment is very sterile and does not allow much vegetation to grow, perfect for wading birds such as Dunlin and Redshank to roost on and little ringed plovers to nest on. And predators have nowhere to hide! <\/p> <p>The location of the 10 metre by 30 metre islands means that the birds are sheltered from North Westerly winds and provide a safe haven when there is bad weather or high tides on the Humber.  The cement works is next to the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of birds) Reads Island reserve which offers a home to up to 50,000 wetland birds.  These birds will find the nearby islands also provide a safe roosting area that is relatively undisturbed when the weather is bad.<\/p> <p>Peter Short, RSPB Humber Reserves site manager comments \u201cOnce the islands are established we hope to attract a wide range of different species using them for roosting and breeding such as dunlin, redshank, lapwing, curlew, ringed plover and avocet.<\/p> <p>\u201cSafe undisturbed areas for breeding waders are at a premium along the Humber which means species like little ringed plover and ringed plover often struggle to find suitable breeding habitat. The islands will give new nesting areas for these two species \u2013 every chick counts towards their conservation,\u201d he concludes.<\/p> <p>\u201cOur long term partnership with the RSPB has enabled us to create some wonderful habitats like the bird islands at South Ferriby. In this case, the expertise of the RSPB on what will make the perfect environment for the birds combined with our surplus materials and land have provided nature with a home,\u201d says Kevin Groombridge, Environmental Manager South Ferriby cement plant. <\/p> <p> -Ends-<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p><b>Notes to editors:<\/b><\/p> <p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; email: <a>Elizabeth.young@cemex.com<\/a> t: 01932 583214. <\/p><ul><li> <more>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website <a href=\"http://www.cemex.co.uk\">www.cemex.co.uk<\/a><\/more><\/li><\/ul><p><more><\/more><\/p><ul><li><more><b>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 <\/b>CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.  We aim to create the best service and the best solutions for a better future.      <br><\/more><more>    <b><\/b><\/more><\/li><li><more><b>A<\/b><\/more><more><b>bout CEMEX: <\/b>CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.
