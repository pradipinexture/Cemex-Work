Other finds include finely worked, leaf-shaped flint arrowheads, serrated blades, stone axes and grinding stones.<\/p>\n<p>About 80 Neolithic monuments have been identified in Britain, but Archaeologists are particularly excited by this one as they expect to uncover the entire circuit of the enclosure.

They regularly attend the Logistic Leadership Days at Thorpe and have always had a valued input into the day. <br><br>They have become CLOCs Champions from 2016, as well as maintaining our FORS gold accreditation status which was first achieved back in 2015.

Expert speakers contributed on current issues related to nature conservation. The event showcased some of the best examples of Quarry restoration and wildlife conservation anywhere in Europe that were entered for the MPA Restoration Awards and the MPA Biodiversity Awards in association with Natural England.  A series of outstanding images were also presented as part of the MPA\u2019s Nature Photo competition. The MPA also launched Quarrywatch which will involve focused nature surveys at designated locations to gain a picture of the species colonising restored quarries and other nature sites. Local wildlife groups, individual enthusiasts and schools will also be invited to take part in the initiative.　<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Commenting, Nigel Jackson, Chief Executive of the MPA, said: \u201cOnce again MPA members\u2019 have demonstrated what an environmentally responsible industry can do to both protect existing and create new habitats. We could not be more proud to showcase what can be achieved by an industry that is uniquely placed to make a net gain to biodiversity.\u201d　<\/p>\n\n<p>MPA members are planning to increase the area of priority habitats on restored sites from 6,000 hectares currently to around 9,000 hectares in coming years, and increase the length of hedgerows planted from 79 km to 237 km.  The area of priority habitat would be equivalent to the size of Cardiff, and hedgerow would stretch from London to Cardiff.<\/p>"

A pre-event safety visit to the site was arranged with the Triathlon organiser to ensure a safe and suitable location for the truck to exhibit. The event took place on Sunday 17th September and went very well, with a large number of visitors and competitors climbing into the cab to see the road from the truck driver\u2019s seat. Demonstrations of the additional safety features fitted to the CEMEX fleet vehicles were well received, along with the high level of training given to develop driver skills. This helps them understand where the danger areas and blind spots associated with large vehicles are and how to avoid them. Thanks go to Phil Hutchinson and Ian Phoenix for organising the event and to North East lead driver, Mark Mann, and Jarrow driver, Lawrence Stobbs, who both gave up Sunday to support the event.

It has over 20 years\u2019 experience in manufacturing pre-stressed concrete sleepers and crossing bearers which are used in high speed, main-line railway track applications and railway lines.

The site has been used by CEMEX for 26 years and employs 90 onsite staff.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Manufacturing large concrete sleepers and crossing bearers requires heavy machinery, with the product often moving around this busy site.  Adhering to strict health and safety procedures at all times is understandably essential for the safety of everyone on site. Terry Gillooly, Washwood Heath Site Manager for CEMEX Rail Solutions, sees health and safety as the No.1 priority and an ongoing process of continuous improvement: \u201cWe are always looking for ways we can improve the site and keep staff working safely.  I put forward the idea of a CCTV system as a means of maintaining site safety.  We could also use it for security as we have our own rail sidings, but this was not the main reason.  We discussed it and thought it was a good idea. \u201cStanley supplies our Time and Attendance equipment\u201d explains Terry \u201cand I mentioned the issues we were having with the CCTV company by chance and they offered their services, which was great.  They did a very good job.  The system is very professional.\u201d STANLEY recommended a 16 camera IP HD CCTV system, capable of providing high definition observation.  A range of external and internal cameras have been installed in strategic positions across the site with all images fed back for monitoring and recording onto a sophisticated network video recorder.  The system runs over CEMEX\u2019s existing IP network, providing considerable cost savings on cabling required for traditional CCTV systems, whilst maintaining quality.  Due to the nature of the site, the entire CCTV system was installed out of hours over three weekends with STANLEY staff working to very strict health and safety criteria.　<\/p>\n<p>CEMEX  is impressed with the finished CCTV system and the way in which the installation was carried out.  \u201cOver several visits to our site, Stanley\u2019s team adhered to all Health and Safety procedures, including the use and operation of the site\u2019s mobile elevated platform\u201d states Terry.  \u201cThe conduct of the team was excellent, and works were completed in a timely manner.  We are very pleased with the CCTV system.\u201d The installation has proven so successful that CEMEX has expanded the system by adding a further eight cameras.<\/p>"

It is known locally for high quality aggregates and ready mix concrete which is delivered across the region. The site was awarded PRIME (Professional Recognition in Mineral Extraction) status at the start of August 2017. <\/p><p>Sam Shepherd has been the Assistant quarry manager and then Quarry manager at CEMEX\u2019s Pallett Hill quarry  over last three years. He says: <em>\u201cMy first involvement with PRIME was back in 2015 and I immediately knew that this was a standard this site could and would achieve. It has  the associated professional benefits of being recognised for what we do, as well as the joint kudos for everyone involved at Pallett Hill, as achieving PRIME is a true team effort.\u201d<\/em> <\/p><p>PRIME is the driving force behind the introduction of the new Technical Member (TMIQ) grade. TMIQ is awarded to employees who achieve vocational and other qualifications, along with the completion of Continuing Professional Development (CPD). Mike Phillips, General Manager, IQ personally conducted the site audit at Pallett Hill. <\/p><p>The quarry is a site close to his heart, having being involved with the site earlier in his career. Mike commented: <em>\u201cIt was great to spend time at Pallett Hill and it brought back many happy memories. Having visited and toured this site I can see a real change. The continued improvements are really noticeable and I hope the further work into the future carries on. The introduction of a quarry vegetable patch was one of many innovative ideas where managers, supervisors and operatives can truly work together and glean true value from their time at work. Personally I was very impressed with Sam\u2019s attitude and approach towards modern day quarry management and this clearly shows it works.\u201d<\/em> <\/p><p>Sam Shepherd, Quarry Manager, CEMEX, adds: <em>\u201cHaving being involved in the steering group for PRIME, I understand the rigour with which the audit process is undertaken, so I am very proud of the team here for being recognised as the true professionals that they are. I know that we are one of the first within CEMEX to achieve this accolade, and hope that many sites will follow in our footsteps. This process has led to improvement not only for myself and my team, but for the site as a whole. We all understand the value of increased morale and engagement, and the celebration of this achievement, along with the friendly competition it will engender is a positive influence for all.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

Swifts will soon be on their way back to Africa so our \u2018new build\u2019 is in preparation for next year. Next summer we look forward to seeing and hearing Swifts as they soar over Rugby rooftops on a summer\u2019s evening,\u201d<\/em> comments Jamie Jordan, Environmental Manager, Rugby Cement Plant.<\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"> Swifts are the perfect house guest. They are only in the UK for three months of the year; make no mess when nesting and help get rid of flying insects and mosquitoes. <\/p><p dir=\"LTR\">Sadly, their numbers have been rapidly declining, due in part it is thought, to the lack of homes in our urban environments. CEMEX is working in partnership with the RSPB to increase the biodiversity of its 400+ sites.<\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"> The introduction of the Swift boxes is one of the measures to help give nature a home. Rebecca Pitman, RSPB Swift Cities Project Officer, says: <em>\u201cThe Swift is truly an urban bird and sadly they have declined by an alarming 47% between 1995\u20132014. <\/em><\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"><em>\"They are now an amber-listed species on the list of Birds of Conservation Concern. When they arrive back in the UK from Africa they return to the exact same location year after year. <\/em><\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"><em>\"Swifts like to nest in the rooftops of old buildings but developments and renovations often destroy suitable sites. The new CEMEX homes at the Cement Plant can offer this great bird a great home,\u201d<\/em> Rebecca concludes.<\/p>"

We formed two teams with one each on the mattock/bar and shovel and barrow \u2013 we soon got it done with good team work and can-do. Thanks also for everyone remembering to bring appropriate PPE for the task and looking out for each other. <\/p><p>CEMEX has a long history supporting 1st Long Itchington Scouts going back to the cement days at Southam, and still rents the scout hut, grounds, cricket pitch and pavilion to the scouts. This is the second lend-a-hand with them. Last year\u2019s project of cutting a safe walkway from the hut to the cricket pitch is still looking good and is in regular use. This is definitely a good example of CEMEX Best for Communities in action. The photo shows work in progress before we got too ragged!\u201d<\/p>"

The keynote lecture examined the factors leading up to this catastrophe and the implications for the UK extractive sector. <\/p><p>Other lectures covered health and safety, geotechnical, hydrogeological, mineral exploration and ecological aspects of the quarrying industry.<br><br>Together with their consultants Wardell Armstrong, CEMEX presented results of their 10 year programme of monitoring of springs in a nature reserve called Monk\u2019s Dale, located 2km to the south of Dove Holes Quarry. <\/p><p> In order to operate effectively the Quarry needs to be dewatered with potential impacts on water features and groundwater dependent ecosystems.  Monk\u2019s Dale Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a spring-supported fen habitat of national and European importance. <\/p><p>The conclusion from the monitoring is that the fen habitat is dependent on groundwater flowing into the valley from a higher level associated with changes in geology and that it lies beyond the influence of operations at the Quarry. <\/p><p>Further information on the EIG conferences can be found at http://www.eigconferences.com or contact Paul Jennings, Senior Geologist in CEMEX\u2019s National Reserves Department, who is on the EIG Committee.<\/p>"

Starting early, the team walked the site, checked CEMEX\u2019s standard health & safety procedures and risk assess the day\u2019s work., then got to business!  <\/p><p>Phil Hiden and Simon Cooke did an amazing job with the post hole borer (not an easy task!) while the rest of us started dismantling the old fence.  The first row of fence went in at a slow pace as the posts were large and required a lot of labour. <\/p><p>Apart from one tough section we were finished the first row by lunch. On the afternoon shift we became a well-oiled machine!  Everyone knew what they were doing and the second row went up at quite a pace. <\/p><p>The job was complete by 3.30pm and the horses were back in the paddock moments after the last tool was taken back to the van.  Sandra Haddon (owner) was over the moon at a job well done.<\/p>"

Chris then contacted the Site Engineer and stated his findings, made them aware of the failings on site and the Site Engineer would then be able to make the relevant changes to the design.  <\/p><p>Following the CEMEX intervention the site has now made the changes the CEMEX Team noted, and because of the way that CEMEX dealt with the issue they have now said that the next contract will be coming our way.

        "Body": "<p>A little over 12 months ago CEMEX Rail Solutions were asked by London Underground  for a design of concrete bearer for curves of less than 200m radius.  <\/p><p>The particular issue with tight curves is that of wheel / rail alignment around the curve. The way to ensure that wheels remain on the track is by use of a check rail next to the running rail; this guides the wheel and keeps it on the rail. <\/p><p>London Underground had designs of 2 base plates, one for the check rail end and one for the running rail on the other end of the bearer but needed to mount it on a concrete bearer. This was not straight forward as there were 2 complications highlighted by a Finite Element Analysis carried out by Durham University.<\/p>  <p>The method of attaching the base plate to the bearer was via a cast in plastic dowell. This is a known crack inducer in pre-stressed concrete due to tensile forcesset up around the dowell. The dowells on one end need to be in close proximity to mounting positions for 3rd and 4th conductor rail mounting positions. <\/p><p>These conductor rails are bolted on again into a plastic insert (another crack inducer). To overcome these issues we have adopted industry practice from Germany and placed a tight fitting helical reinforcement around the plastic dowells to contain cracks. <\/p><p>The plastic inserts for conductor rail mounting have been replaced by metal inserts.  A second finite element analysis by Durham University concluded that these changes had significantly reduced the risk of crack propogation within the unit.  A further 2 variants of check rail bearer were designed (short ended at either end) at the same time to allow for drainage catch pits which are sometimes in the way trackside.<\/p>  <p>Thanks to the contribution of our Operations, Maintenance and Quality Departments the 3 variants went into full production of around 100 units per week at Somercotes in early April and our client is forecasting a positive future demand by end of the year.   <\/p><p>A further variant is now being looked at to incorporate standard pandrol fastclip fastenings and inclined concrete; this would be used where the client has noise and vibration issues where a soft undersleeper pad could be used.<\/p>"

Even if they are on public pathways or gardens, both in our towns and rural areas, the charity says. <\/p><p>And it is sometimes the safer option, particularly when it comes to baby seagulls. Their parents are notoriously protective of their young, and have been known to dive-bomb anyone straying too close to their chicks across coastal towns. Some have in the past been hurt by gulls\u2019 claws or beaks after getting too close. <\/p><p>It\u2019s possible victims are not even aware they had strayed too close to a gull chick, the RSPB said. RSBP spokesman Martin Jensen told us: <em>\u201cHerring gulls take parenting very seriously \u2013 whether they are on an unpopulated coastal island or in a town or city around the extensive UK coastline.<\/em><\/p><p><em>\u201cDefending their nest and their young is part of their DNA. On a coastal island, if a crow or a great black-backed gull tries to steal and eat an egg or chick, it will be repelled with all the parent gull\u2019s strength and other gulls will come to assist. It is no different in the towns and cities of the UK.<\/em><\/p><p><em>\u201cIf the gulls believe their eggs or young are in danger, they understandably become very protective and can be aggressive in defence of their young.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

This system will automatically brake to slow vehicles down when a potential collision is detected. <\/p>  <p>A full guided tour of the factory was given, seeing a truck assembled from parts arriving at one end to driving off the line. The Team saw a CEMEX truck on the assembly line and saw how closely the Teams had to work on the line to achieve the continuous flow along the moving line and the quality control involved. The Team at DAF where impressed with CEMEX commitment to train young drivers and we had great feedback from our guys on how informative and enjoyable the experience had been. <\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Last week Cemex Croydon plant became the first in the country to produce a new branded mix called Advanced Decking.  Advanced decking is a self compacting, self levelling flooring concrete, for floors in modular buildings and was designed in partnership with Propex. <\/p>  <p>Sharon Baker, sales rep, was approached by Advance Flooring Solutions to look at two jobs in the Croydon area, the first one at a school in Purley. Our Technical Manager Kevin D'souza worked with Darren Williams of Propex to design the mix and run trials, only once we were completely happy did we go ahead with the pours, each load had steel and polypropylene fibres added at the plant. <\/p> <p>As with other products in the Advanced portfolio, Advanced Decking utilises fibres to eliminate the need for conventional steel mesh on site. This VAP (value added product) has two great selling points, first Heath and Safety, as there is no need to spend two days prepping the floor with steel mesh, the second time saved not having to do this, and there\u2019s no need to spend hours power floating the finished surface. <\/p> <p>Sharon commented, \u201cthe success of these pours was only achievable with the hard work of all the people involved, at the batching plant staff, and the drivers who had to negotiate the difficult site access, but this they did with ease. This job just goes to show what can be achieved when we work as a team, a great job well done, thanks to all those involved. We have other supplies in the pipeline and there will be a formal product launch in the very near future.\u201d <\/p><p> <\/p>"

The concrete flows and fully compacts without the need for external vibration enabling customers to place concrete in the most difficult locations whilst still maintaining all the hardened properties associated with traditional concrete. <\/p><p>In total we supplied 600m of material. The contract consisted of 2 phases over a period of 18 months with completion in August 2013.

This area features fair faced concrete columns topped with similarly fair faced 2 metre deep diagonal beams.<\/p><p>Hovering above the hotel\u2019s roof sits the cantilevered SkyLounge.  This metallic element links to external roof gardens with incredible 360 degree views of London.<\/p><p>In conjunction with the design features, extensive passive and active environmental measures have been integrated into the building, reducing carbon emissions by over 30%. The whole building achieved a BREEAM rating of \u201cVery Good\u201d<\/p><p>One of the key requirements was for the highest acoustic attenuation between bedrooms, so the SCC was used to infill the twin wall system consisting of concrete frames and walls. <\/p><p>The only applied finish to the concrete is a nominal sprayed plaster, which allows the concrete\u2019s thermal mass to be used to aid heating and cooling.  The combined measures means the building has achieved an EPC rating of B, exceptional for a fully conditioned 4-star hotel.<\/p><p>CEMEX technical staff had early involvement with concrete supplied for various applications including the fair faced finish and Grade 50/60 self-compacting concrete from Stepney and Canning Town plants.<\/p><p><strong>Thanks to Concrete magazine for the photographs and information.<\/strong><\/p><br>"

This pattern has been reported nationally where the early hot spell in March is thought to have kick-started the breeding early. <\/p><p>Volunteers at the site have been hard at work in the recent months cutting back the lush paths and tracks to the hides, which had a growing spurt with all the rain. Work was also undertaken on Tern Island, pulling ragwort, and repairing the MGL boat.

There is a large winter gull roost which can hold as many as 28000 birds.  Passing birds of prey include the majestic osprey, whilst buzzard and sparrowhawk can be seen regularly.   Almost any migrant bird can turn up - black tern are regulars but species like little egret and the more uncommon waders are also seen.     <\/p><p>Lackford Lakes has a thriving visitor centre with regular activities ranging from bird watching courses, to art exhibitions, to family activity days.  The reserve is free to visit and open year round.  Suffolk Wildlife Trust is the county\u2019s leading environmental charity and is supported by more than 26,000 members \u2013 joining the Trust is the best way to show your support for their conservation activities.  Find out more at: <\/p> <p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/lackfordlakes\">http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/lackfordlakes<\/a><\/p> <p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lackford-Lakes-Suffolk-Wildlife-Trust/129367447183011\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lackford-Lakes-Suffolk-Wildlife-Trust/129367447183011<\/a><\/p>Lackford Lakes is well worth a visit year round, but the months of November and December are particularly special as both the gull and starling roosts build in numbers as the sun goes down."

These tragic statistics are a reminder of the importance of being vigilant at all the sites we are responsible for.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will be sending promotional materials including posters and videos for our employees to take home and share with loved ones to make home a safer environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will be covering Safety in the Home, including Safe Bed Time, Safe Play Time and Safe Leisure Time \u2013 so let\u2019s all Stay Safe!<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"

The very best from each of our business sectors are selected to compete for the Sword, based on injury performance, Health and Safety inspection and audit scores, HSE enforcement action, etc. The best in each sector then submit a written entry and make a presentation to the UK Leadership Team, who then vote for an overall winner.<\/p>\n\n<p>For CEMEX London to win the Sword for 2017 is a great honour and recognition of our commitment and effort to work as a team and look after each other. Sincere thanks go to everyone for contributing to this success. We feel very proud of what we have achieved, but we also recognise that things can go wrong very quickly with Health and Safety and that usually means someone gets seriously hurt.<\/p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s always nice to win something but most of all we feel proud that we reached our 10 years lost time injury free milestone, which is the very best reward and will continue to focus on our future to continually improve.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Well done to everyone involved \u2013 employees and contractors \u2013 for this much deserved recognition.<\/p>"

The product can be mixed onsite by our foam production units or delivered in trucks premixed.

The renovation project required a mass filling of the existing basement with 20N/mm2 concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>When contractor, Paul John construction approached CEMEX for a suitable voidfill solution, we proposed to use Porofoam, our low density foamed concrete. Using Porofoam enabled the pour to be completed in less than half the time than standard concrete. Due to it\u2019s reduced plastic density Porofoam could be placed in much thicker layers reducing lateral pressures exerted on the 165 year old internal walls of the basement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Porofoam is also self-compacting and self-levelling, which made it much easier for the contractor to place in the network of basement chambers. Porofoam is available in a range of densities and strengths and is manufactured using our proprietary CEMEX admixtures. For this project CEMEX delivered around 60m3 of pre-mixed Porofoam over 2 days to fill the void which achieved the required 20N/mm2 concrete strength.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/porofoam-lightweight-foamed-concrete-for-voidfill.aspx\" style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#b23035; color:#ffffff; font-weight:bold; float:right;\">Foamed Concrete<\/a><\/p>"

At the start of the spring we did a review of what areas our support would better benefit. I noticed that the wooden sleepers that allow members of the public safe access to other levels of the Nature Reserve were clearly becoming unsafe through wood deterioration; the hand rail had also become loose and was ready to break. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"I offered to have myself and a team replace all the sleepers that were needed and repair the hand rail to ensure many more years of use. Sometimes the best plans don\u2019t always work out - we\u2019d planned to replace 21 sleepers but following the long period of warm weather the ground was so hard it slowed us down a little. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"We managed to replace 13 sleepers on the day and we concreted-in posts to stabilise the hand rail and repainted it, offering it a few more years of use. I am proud of the work we do at Pennytown Ponds and the support we give the local community is amazing. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"Gary, our friend from the local charity, Groundwork, was working along us throughout the day and was over the moon with the results. The team here at Somercotes worked very hard so my thanks to them for making this happen.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>A month after our review the Reserve was visited by the Green Flag judges and was deemed of sufficient standard to retain the Green Flag status which has been held for a number of years.<\/p>\n\n<p>The judges highlighted that the wooden steps needed replacing and when told that this work was already scheduled with the help of CEMEX they were impressed that the work was already planned and secondly a local company was involved in the important maintenance work on a local Nature Reserve.<\/p>"

Turning your garden into a sanctuary for woodland wildlife in autumn can make all the difference to our native species\u2019 survival.<\/p>\n\n<p>That doesn\u2019t have to mean pricey garden centre buys or hours of work. Something as simple as filling up your bird feeder, leaving your compost heap to nature or adding a few late-flowering plants will attract more animals and ensure your new guests are safe, fed and watered until the cold months have passed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the RSPB\u2019s top winter tips:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Don\u2019t be so tidy! Leave an area of your garden unkempt for wildlife to live in.<\/li>\n\t<li>Build a hedgehog house. Woodpiles are great for our spiky friends to live in and hunt for insects.<\/li>\n\t<li>Buy a bird box and give birds somewhere to shelter in the winter.<\/li>\n\t<li>Keep your pond uncovered as it will remain a crucial spot for birds to drink and find bugs and insects to eat.<\/li>\n\t<li>Top up your bird bath so birds can stay clean and keep it ice free. Putting a table tennis ball in will help as the breeze will move it and keep the bath free from ice.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add a hedge! These are great for privacy and wildlife. Evergreen hedges such as holly \u2018Handsworth New Silver\u2019 and Firethorn \u2018Teton\u2019 (Pyracantha) not only provide year-round colour but their berries provide winter food for garden birds.<\/li>\n\t<li>Make fences hedgehog friendly. If hedging isn\u2019t an option for your garden, you can create a five inch hole in the bottom of your fence or gate so that hedgehogs and other wildlife can crawl in and out.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add late flowering plants. Nectar and pollen tend to be in short supply during this time, but they are still essential foods for many insects \u2013 such as Michaelmas daisies, sedums, ivy and asters. Also, include some native trees and shrubs in your garden such as rowan, holly, guelder rose, wild rose, blackthorn or hawthorn.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add a butterfly box so insects can sleep soundly over the colder months.<\/li>\n\t<li>Fill your birdfeeder with high energy foods. Fat balls and cakes are great it\u2019s best to get the hanging feeders or enclosed ones so that the grey squirrels don\u2019t get it all!<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

        "Body": "<p>Building houses in the UK is usually centred around traditional bricks and mortar which have been the backbone of the building trade for many years. When CEMEX were approached by an ambitious self-builder, Adrian Corrigall back in 2017, the challenge was set to help create a modern family home utilising one of the most commonly used materials on the planet\u2026concrete. Usually the sole preserve of large commercial buildings, cast-in-situ concrete has rarely been the material of choice for self-builders, but Adrian\u2019s vision was very different to that of your average self-builder. Inspired by a visit to a landmark property in Mexico designed by architects Reyes Rios + Larrain Studio and supplied by CEMEX, the idea for Concrete House was shaped by the henequen hacienda style and the intelligent fabric-first design principles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concrete House was designed by Graeme Laughlin of the award-winning practice RAW Architecture Workshop. His design gives Adrian, his wife Megan and their three children a functional yet stylish house, laid out in clearly defined \u2018wings\u2019 which spur off from the central kitchen and living areas. Each area of the house sits at a slightly different level, giving a greater sense of individuality and separation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The over-riding design principles for the house were energy efficiency and use of disruptive methodologies. Adrian\u2019s vision to create a high performing house for his family was equally matched by his willingness to challenge the accepted norms of house building in the UK, and perhaps even discover a way to revolutionise the way we think about building.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX provided early stage materials advice to Adrian and his design team to help to realise some of these goals. From the start it was clear that concrete was to be the primary material, but aside from structure, what other functions could concrete take on?<\/p>\n\n<p>Working closely with the CEMEX Research Group in Switzerland, a range of innovative concrete solutions were proposed to Adrian and Graeme during a 2 day workshop. During this time, key principles of thermal and structural design were defined alongside an intensive materials selection process.<\/p>\n\n<p>The design of the structure was centred around cast-in-situ \u2018sandwich panels\u2019, comprising 2 leaves of concrete with a central core of insulating material. This method of solid wall construction has a number of clear advantages including superior air-tightness and significantly reduced thermal conductivity values.<\/p>\n\n<p>Building in this way usually requires <span style=\"color:black\">tons<\/span> of steel reinforcement, cranes to lift formwork <span style=\"color:black\">which<\/span> can take up valuable program time. In order to counter this, CEMEX proposed the use of its <b>Resilia HP<\/b> Fibre-Reinforced Self Compacting Concrete for the structural walls and horizontal elements. Selecting a high-performance fibre-reinforced concrete allowed Adrian\u2019s design team to significantly reduce the amount of steel reinforcement, up to 60% less than in the original design. <b>Resilia HP<\/b> &nbsp;is not only a high strength product, it is also highly ductile, allowing for thinner sections to be cast. This design choice also had an added benefit in speeding up the cycle time between casting of the walls, as there was very little steel to detail and fix. Being a self-compacting concrete (SCC) also meant that the material could be placed into the forms with minimal intervention from the contractor, allowing them to pour each element quicker and more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is widely accepted that concrete performs equally as well as a thermal envelope, providing a great natural method of keeping houses at an even temperature, regardless of the external temperature. But even the most efficient houses can suffer from heat loss at key structural junctions. Following a thorough thermal modelling process assisted by CEMEX Research Group, some key areas of the structure were identified as being prone to heat loss, particularly where horizontal and vertical elements meet. The use of another advanced concrete was proposed to mitigate this. <b>Insularis<\/b>,<b> <\/b>a lightweight concrete, was developed by CEMEX to provide a thermal break in concrete structures. With a much lower thermal conductivity value than traditional concretes, Insularis gives designers the option of continuing the concrete through the junction without compromising on strength or adding in other materials. For Concrete House, <b>Insularis<\/b> was used to form the kickers at the base of the external walls, dealing with the heat loss issues and helping Adrian\u2019s vision of an energy efficient build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Speed and efficiency were also a huge part of the build, and to support this Adrian formed a partnership with Peri UK to use their new Duo® lightweight formwork system. Duo can be assembled by hand in much quicker times, due to its plastic composition and low overall weight. Traditional formworks often require a crane to lift each section into place, an expense not associate with the average self-build project. CEMEX worked closely with Peri and Adrian\u2019s design team to make sure that the <b>Resilia <span style=\"color:black\">HP<\/span> <\/b>concrete would perform well in conjunction with the Duo system. Early site trials were conducted using both brand new products, which allowed CEMEX to optimise the mix design and also improve the production process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Work began on site in September 2017, the site being levelled and foundations being prepared. CEMEX supplied 109m3 of traditional GEN3 concrete for what was probably the most straightforward part of the concrete works. In early November the work to the suspended slabs began in earnest. With a high water table and potential for clay heave, Adrian was forced to adopt additional measures to protect the ground slab, which included a level of steel reinforcement. For this element CEMEX designed the <b>&nbsp;Resilia Conventional<\/b> mix, taking account of the presence of the steel reinforcement and the reduced need for the concrete to perform to a higher flexural strength value. Around 120m3 of <b>Resilia Conventional<\/b> was supplied to form the ground slabs and upstands between level changes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Into December and the first walls were ready to be poured. Due to the layout of the building, Adrian and his build team had to carefully select the build route around the site to avoid conflict between the formwork supports. Smaller sections of walls at low lying parts of the building were completed first, in a methodical sequence which then dictated the speed of build. As the build team became more accustomed to the <b>Resilia HP<\/b>, they were able to place lager volumes per pour.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pouring the walls was not without its share of drama, with the supplying plant being located much further from the project than usually done. This distance caused some early stage issues with logistics and this was made clear when one CEMEX vehicle suffered a puncture whilst travelling to site. The resultant delay in getting the material to site caused a pour line along an external courtyard wall. Fortunately, the <b>Resilia HP<\/b> was designed with four hours of consistence retention, so the material was able to be placed after the short delay with only an aesthetic line on the courtyard wall. Following on from this CEMEX changed the timing and method of production at the plant, allowing more loads to leave for site earlier in the morning to beat the morning rush hour.<\/p>\n\n<p>In January 2018 the first requirement for <b>Insularis<\/b> came around, another first for CEMEX UK to produce. Following trials with assistance from CEMEX Research Group, we prepared to pour the first set of kickers. The first attempt at pumping the material ran into issues, where the concrete would not immediately pump. The decision was taken to hand place the material due to the time limits in place. CEMEX went away and made some modifications to the mix for the second attempt some days later. Again, initially the material blocked the pump, but with some adjustments to the pump configuration the material finally flowed into place. Variations in the raw material alongside the configuration of the pump had caused the issues, but working together with the site team these were overcome.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final structural elements were the roof slabs, where again the levels rose and fell across the building. More upstands and parapets were cast in an intricate sequence of pours planned by Adrian and his team.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once structurally complete there was one more element that required assistance from CEMEX. The final floor construction called for underfloor heating pipes to be laid, with a finished concrete or screed floor. Working with Adrian again, CEMEX proposed a number of options including screeds, but finally it was another concrete which fit the bill. A bespoke version of our <b>Evolution<\/b> Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) was designed to allow a finished concrete surface, without compromising on the floor levels throughout the build and also allowing for a powerfloated finish. The mix, called <b>Evolution F <\/b>contained a range of CEMEX Admixtures which were added to aid the placement of the material whilst controlling the consistence retention to give the contractor time to work with the material.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the completion of the project CEMEX had supplied 4 brand new mix designs all developed and modified to suit the project, with the ongoing assistance of the CEMEX Research Group, the wider CEMEX UK business and related supply chain partners. The project has served as a platform for development of not only new variations of mixes but also the range of applications and sectors which could benefit from utilising these new advances in concrete technology.<\/p>"

Through them businesses gain a single point of contact for assured advice on meeting certain regulatory standards across their whole operation, rather than separately from each local authority area they work in. It works by requiring local regulators to respect the advice and inspection plans provided to partner businesses by lawful primary authorities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Simon Wilkes, Head of WRS, said: <em>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal in everybody\u2019s best interest. CEMEX takes its compliance responsibilities under these environmental regulations very seriously, and we have the capability and expertise to provide consistent advice to them to be applied at the local level nationwide. Primary authority partnerships like this can save a lot of time and money.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The partnership between CEMEX and WRS covers documentation, procedures, compliance, and inspection plans across all of CEMEX\u2019s activities that are subject to local authority air pollution regulation and require \u2018Part B\u2019 environmental permits, under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to editors:<\/p>\n\n<p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; Elizabeth.young@cemex.com t: 07920 245656<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/li>\n\t<li>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX, leading building materials supplier, working in partnership with energy, services and regeneration group ENGIE, will now be provided with 100% renewable electricity to all supplied sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE has been providing electricity to over 150 CEMEX UK sites for over 10 years, also supplying gas to 33 of these sites. The current contract is to be extended for a further 12 months.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of the electricity supplied to the sites will be from 100% renewable energy sources including wind energy. As these sources produce zero carbon emissions, this makes a significant contribution to reducing CEMEX UK\u2019s carbon footprint. ENGIE\u2019s renewable electricity supply is underpinned by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs).<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE and CEMEX UK\u2019s commitment to renewable electricity is therefore making a positive contribution to the decarbonisation of energy in the UK. In the 2017/2018 financial year, renewable energy made up 34% of ENGIE\u2019s fuel supply mix, compared to 29% nationally.<\/p>\n\n<p>Martin Hills, Head of Energy and Carbon at CEMEX in the UK commented: \u201cCement manufacture is inherently energy-intensive and we work hard to minimise energy consumption within the process constraints. The switch to electricity from renewable sources is playing a key role in our carbon reduction strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is also taking advantage of ENGIE\u2019s demand side services, such as load management to avoid peak tariffs and rapid frequency response, which generates extra revenue for CEMEX UK. ENGIE also manages all contractual requirements with National Grid on CEMEX UK\u2019s behalf.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nicola Lovett, Divisional CEO of Business Energy &amp; Services at ENGIE, observed: \u201cOur 10-year partnership with CEMEX UK has delivered major cost and environmental benefits, while also generating additional revenue for the company. Our ability to provide 100% renewable electricity represents another important step forward in addressing CEMEX UK\u2019s sustainability commitments.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Ends<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>About ENGIE<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE is a leading energy and services company focused on three key activities: production and supply of energy, facilities management and regeneration. Our 17,000 employees combine these capabilities for the benefit of individuals, businesses and communities throughout the UK &amp; Ireland.<\/p>\n\n<p>We enable customers to embrace a lower carbon, more efficient and increasingly digital world. Our customers benefit from our energy efficient and smart building solutions, the provision of effective and innovative services, the transformation of neighbourhoods through regeneration projects, and the supply of reliable, flexible and renewable energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE improves lives through better living and working environments. We help to balance performance with responsibility, enabling progress in a harmonious way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Globally, the ENGIE Group employs 150,000 people worldwide and achieved revenues of \u20ac66.6 billion in 2016.<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The 57 aggregate tipper trucks will be operating at CEMEX locations throughout the country, spreading the vital safety message to pedestrians in the community. The trucks are DAF 8-wheelers which will carry 20 tonnes of aggregates to be used in construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the first time the safety message includes images of three different groups of vulnerable pedestrians - school children, the not-so-young and Mums with babies and toddlers. The aim is to target the message specifically at these groups. In addition, there is the original image, that of a \u2018generic\u2019 pedestrian.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur trucks are moving billboards and can help us save lives, in this case those of pedestrians. In total we have around 800 vehicles travelling approximately 39 million miles. It\u2019s a great opportunity to use some of these vehicles to spread the message of \u2018Don\u2019t Chance it\u2019, that is don\u2019t step out in front of or close to a large goods vehicle,\u201d comments Dave Hart, Supply Chain Director.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CEMEX Pedestrian safety campaign was launched at the beginning of 2018, following on from their highly successful and market-leading cyclist safety campaign. The company aims to engage with pedestrians to highlight the potential dangers around large goods vehicles and the part pedestrians can play in staying safe.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2016 25% of road fatalities were pedestrians, up 10% compared to 2015 according to the Department of Transport.<\/p>\n\n<p>During 2018 CEMEX has produced a range of materials to inform pedestrians about how to stay safe: a safety leaflet, posters and video available through its website www.cemex.co.uk.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ends<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; email: Elizabeth.young@cemex.com t: 07920 245656<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/li>\n\t<li>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.

The first truck of its type was on display at the 2019 Concrete Show.<\/p>\n\n<p>The latest innovations focus not only on driver safety but that of vulnerable road users and have been engineered to address the principal concerns of today\u2019s Readymix concrete industry including accidents with falls from height &nbsp;and slips, trips and falls. &nbsp;Other innovations are designed to help reduce the environmental impact.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the new systems reduces emissions by managing the drum speed and engine condition during travelling and at the site. It is possible to make a saving of up to 90% whilst waiting to deliver on site. After delivery the Hymix system provides for self-sufficient wash down and has also introduced a method of neutralizing the pH of the wash water making it harmless and safe to dispose of into the waste water system.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the driver these new developments will reduce their workload allowing them to concentrate on safe driving. Additional safety features help reduce the frequency of rollovers and unplanned incidents whilst the Hymix site light system (SLS) has been extended to improve visibility further in low light conditions and when maneuvering in tight spaces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>James Harper, General Manager at Hymix, said: \u201cImproving safety and helping reduce both serious and minor accidents is a high priority in our vehicle development programme and we aim to work with the industry and key stakeholders to ensure the safety of all involved &nbsp;Our roads are getting busier and potential for danger is greater than ever, it is for everyone in the supply chain to contribute in mitigating risks to all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Charlie Stanford \u2013 National Fleet Liaison Manager at Cemex UK said \u201cWe will one of the first in the industry to take a truck with the new features.

In December 2013 floods devasted the CEMEX plant putting it out of production for over 12 months and causing immense damage to local homes and businesses. It was estimated that over £50million worth of damage was caused.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut it is more that the damage itself, the local community, of which we are part, live in fear of a similar event happening again. With the new flood defences we will all have peace of mind,\u201d comments Piotr Klepak, CEMEX Plant Director.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mike Dugher, Deputy Director at the Environment Agency, said: \u201cAfter many years of hard work with our partners, we\u2019re pleased to mark the start of construction on a flood defence that will help protect around 150 homes plus local industry, agriculture, infrastructure and economy.

        "Body": "<p>The Port of London Authority (PLA) is investing in the new conveyor and infrastructure as part of their Investment Plan. The development will enable CEMEX Marine dredgers to discharge sand and gravel more efficiently for processing at the Northfleet site.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Marine dredgers bring sand and gravel from the North Sea and other off-shore locations into three wharves along the Thames including Northfleet, primarily for use in the London construction market. The site currently handles approximately 500,000 tonnes of material a year, which will increase to approximately 800,000 \u2013 850,000 tonnes with the system due to the faster turn round of vessels.<\/p>\n\n<p>The PLA\u2019s Investment Plan is principally aimed at delivering the goals of the Thames Vision, which targets greater river use, alongside an improving environment. The Plan\u2019s goals are to sustain or increase port trade/river use and generate commercial returns.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur investment at Northfleet is the first under the Investment Plan and is a perfect example of what we are looking to achieve,\u201d explained PLA chief executive, Robin Mortimer. \u201cWe are financing the improved discharge systems that will marry up well with the new dredger that CEMEX has on order. In combination this will secure the long term future of cargo handling at this key site and generate a commercial return which we can re-invest in other river projects.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Marine Director, Kurt Cowdrey comments \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to partner with the PLA to improve cargo handling on the Thames. London is an important market for us and this investment will provide a platform for continued use and future growth at Northfleet.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe capital needs approximately 10 million tonnes* of sand, gravel and crushed rock every year to build, maintain and improve housing, buildings and infrastructure. The use of water to transport building materials to the heart of the city reduces the need for long distance lorry movements, with every dredger reducing the need for 250 lorries on our busy roads.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The new dry discharge system will be completed mid to end June 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\u2013 ends \u2013<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Date: 22nd April 2019 Earth Day, a global celebration of our planet, is celebrated in more than 193 countries by over a billion people. This year as part of the Earth Day celebrations, CEMEX Europe colleagues specializing in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) will be holding workshops for school children at schools near CEMEX operations. The theme of the workshops will be to support one of the main Earth Day\u2019s principles, to help end plastic pollution.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is expected that the workshops will increase the environmental awareness of this significant topic by encouraging pupils to learn about recycling and upcycling as a method of transforming plastic waste into usable objects.<\/p>\n\n<p>2.5 billion tons of waste are generated in EU countries every year, according to the European Commission. The key reasons for this waste are the result of excessive consumption, over production and ill-informed buying habits without consideration of the longevity and durability of products.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is committed to minimizing the impact of its operations on the environment and to ensure it is the best possible neighbor in the communities in which it operates. Izabella Rokicka Communications and CSR Director, CEMEX Europe comments \u201cAs a company we develop products and building solution to build more sustainable construction and infrastructure which communities need. At the same time, we aim to work with those communities to provide solutions that improve the quality of life for all.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis project aims to educate young people in a fun and innovative way about waste and how they can help tackle some of the environmental issues that we face. Hopefully it will encourage them to challenge the throw-away culture, as well as reduce the amount of waste that is generated going forward. This is the first pan-European activity and it\u2019s a great start to future projects.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The workshops will be held throughout 2019 in the seven European countries where the company operates: UK, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and Croatia. The workshops will be organized in cooperation with local schools, and run jointly with local social partners specializing in recycling and upcycling.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services to customers and communities in more than 50 countries.

        "Body": "<p>Cambusmore quarry in northern Scotland was the most diverse of all sites surveyed, with 200 species recorded in total. This included 15 Red List birds, six protected mammals and 66 flowering plants. There were regular sightings of pine martens, ospreys, Atlantic salmon, otters and high numbers of red squirrel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Raynes quarry in north Wales is the most improved site, with a total of 132 recorded species. The creation of a wildflower meadow has been successful, with 87 different varieties of flowering plant spotted, including several types of orchid. This has in turn attracted many different butterflies and moths, such as ringlet, small heath, common blue, dingy skipper, dark green fritillary and cinnabar moth. There are plans for goats to be used to graze the wildflower meadow in Autumn as a natural method of scrub control.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The survey has been relaunched for the coming year, with the aim to expand it across the UK, covering all 35 quarries. This monitoring is vital as it helps to inform and develop the Biodiversity Action Plans at each site; assessing how activities such as planting wildflower meadows, wetland creation or installation of bat boxes are doing, and highlighting areas for potential improvement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Sean Cassidy, Regional Environmental Manager for Sustainability, commented: <em>\u201cEncouraging biodiversity across our business locations is a priority for CEMEX and this initiative has demonstrated the success of these efforts. It\u2019s a great opportunity to reflect on the work completed so far and consider how it can be developed further, while also encouraging our teams to get involved and appreciate the wildlife for themselves.

Richard Grant, Site Manager for Knights Brown, explained: \u201cThe wind turbine base was a bit unusual as it was cast entirely above ground and located within a busy 24-hour a day wine processing plant. The C50 Concrete mix design was also out of the ordinary with the inclusion of fibres and admixtures.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe 660m³ concrete pour was well planned out and executed. It went better than we even anticipated as we were able to supply two concrete pumps with over 100 deliveries in a under 10 hours. The wine processing plant remained fully functional with minimum disruption throughout the day. The end clients on this project were very impressed with the professionalism of all of those involved on the day.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Go uses the latest digital-industrial technology available through desktops and mobile devices to allow customers to place orders, track shipments, manage invoices and make payments for CEMEX\u2019s building products including bagged and bulk cement, readymixed concrete and aggregates.

        "Body": "<ul style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\">\n\t<li>Energy Vault\u2019s transformative energy storage technology solves a key challenge for renewables, which have struggled to replace, in a significant manner, fossil fuel power due to production unpredictability and intermittency of wind and sunlight. Consequently, energy storage solutions that can harness energy from renewable sources become vital if cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy are sought.<\/li>\n\t<li>In the absence of longer duration and more cost-effective energy storage, the amount of electricity that can be delivered to the grid from renewable energy sources, even though now widely affordable, has been limited.<\/li>\n\t<li>For the first time, Energy Vault\u2019s system enables renewables to deliver baseload power below the cost of fossil fuels 24 hours a day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This investment follows a previously announced technology partnership with CEMEX to provide concrete and other composite material technology for Energy Vault\u2019s storage towers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Energy Vault\u2019s breakthrough technology was inspired by pumped hydro plants that rely on the power of gravity and the movement of water to store and discharge electricity. This solution is based on the same well-understood principles of physics and mechanical engineering used in those plants. Energy Vault\u2019s system replaces water with custom made concrete bricks through an innovative use of low-cost materials. The massive bricks are combined with its patented system design and proprietary algorithm-based software to operate a newly designed crane. The crane orchestrates the energy storage tower and electricity charge/discharge while accounting for a variety of factors, including energy supply and demand volatility, weather elements and other variables such as inertia and system deflection.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result, Energy Vault can deliver all the benefits of a gravity-based pumped hydro system with lower price, higher round trip efficiency, without the requirement for specific land topographies and negative environmental or wildlife impacts. Importantly, with Energy Vault\u2019s longer duration and more cost-effective energy storage, electricity from renewables can be delivered for less than the price of fossil fuels 24 hours a day for the first time. In April 2019, Energy Vault won the World Changing Idea Award from Fast Company in the Energy category for the unprecedented economic and environmental benefits its technology provides.<\/p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cEnergy storage that enables power to be delivered for less than the cost of fossil fuels is critical as the world shifts away from its reliance on carbon-based fuels to renewable energy,\u201d<\/i> said Gonzalo Galindo, CEO of CEMEX Ventures. <i>\u201cEnergy Vault\u2019s storage technology is transformational, and we\u2019re extremely pleased to broaden our relationship and support the company\u2019s efforts. The investment is also important because it complements the CEMEX R&amp;D partnership and will accelerate our corporate objectives to achieve a carbon-free industrial footprint.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cCEMEX is a key strategic partner that adds critical innovations in material science that enhance both the economics and longevity of our energy storage system, and we\u2019re thrilled to expand our partnership to welcome CEMEX Ventures as an investor,\u201d said Robert Piconi, chief executive officer and co-founder, Energy Vault. \u201cThe combination of CEMEX\u2019s smart concrete solutions, significant global infrastructure and now its strategic investment will accelerate our ability to enable renewable energy to replace fossil fuels 24 hours a day.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n\n<p>For more information on Energy Vault, please visit energyvault.ch<\/p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2017, CEMEX Ventures focuses on helping overcome the main challenges and capitalizing on the opportunity areas in the construction ecosystem through sustainable solutions.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX and GB Railfreight (GBRf) presented the new CEMEX-liveried locomotive at a dedicated naming ceremony held at Dove Holes Quarry, Buxton.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe new locomotive is called The Cemex Express. The name was unveiled at the event by record producer and rail enthusiast Pete Waterman. Resplendent in the white, blue and red colours of the CEMEX brand, the vehicle recognises the partnership between GBRf and CEMEX, which has now been in place for one year.<br />\nThe Cemex Express, a Class 66 Locomotive, will travel typically between Dove Holes quarry, carrying premium aggregate for our readymix and asphalt plants, and external customers throughout the UK. It will pull 22 to 26 hopper wagons that discharge their loads from underneath directly onto the plant\u2019s conveyors. A single trainload can deliver up to 2,000 tons of material in one trip and will make over 200 trips for CEMEX each year; the equivalent of over 20,000 truckloads.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nDavid Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK &amp; France, commented: \u201cThe transport of our product by rail is of ever-increasing importance to CEMEX as we look to make our operations as sustainable as possible. Rail is a far more environmentally friendly method of transport than trucks on the road, as a train burns significantly less fuel per ton-mile than road vehicles, saving around 50% in CO2 emissions.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX UK currently transports 2.6 million tonnes of aggregate by rail each year which equates to approximately 100,000 trucks off the road; enough to build 40,000 houses; and we want to continue to build on this. We are very proud of our partnership with GBRf and hope that together we will be able to transport more and more by rail safely whilst reducing the number of truck movements.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nLex Russell, Managing Director for UK Materials North at CEMEX, added: \u201cDove Holes is one of CEMEX\u2019s most important quarries and generates several million tonnes of limestone aggregates every year, as well as asphalt, readymix, concrete products and dry silo mortar. &nbsp;By rail we then supply many locations across the UK including key cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham and London.<br />\n\u201cIt was therefore the perfect location to unveil The Cemex Express locomotive and take the opportunity to thank those in our team and at GBRf for their hard work and dedication to our rail partnership.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nJohn Smith, Managing Director of GBRf, said \u201cWe are delighted to unveil this fantastic Class 60 locomotive, painted in the CEMEX livery and representing our two organisations\u2019 ongoing partnership. This contract is demonstrative of the role rail freight has to play in helping the UK to cut carbon emissions and to improve air quality.&nbsp;<br />\nOn average, one gallon of fuel will move one tonne of goods 246 miles on the rail network, while the same amount will only get you 88 miles by road. Rail freight\u2019s CO2 emissions are 76 per cent lower than road\u2019s, per tonne carried. An average freight train removes 60 HGV journeys from the roads and the largest up to 160. When this is combined with rail\u2019s advantageous performance in terms of nitrous oxide and particulate matter emissions, rail freight demonstrates a clear contribution to the challenge of meeting the UK\u2019s carbon-cutting targets.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:&nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide. In this country, we are a leading provider of aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete and rail sleepers with annual sales of around £1 billion.<\/p>\n\n<p>For further CEMEX details please contact Sarah Murphy; email: <a href=\"mailto:sarah.murphy@cemex.com\">sarah.murphy@cemex.com<\/a>&nbsp;or call&nbsp;07557 319972<\/p>"

The inclusion of a central mixer also enables special products such as traditional sand cement screed and flowing screeds like Supaflo to be produced, increasing the product range available.&nbsp;<br />\nAs the plant is sited directly in the quarry, it means materials will no longer have to be transported from the Bramshill to Eversley by truck, dramatically decreasing the number of trucks on local roads and offering substantial eco advantages. With only cement now needed to be brought in, it is believed this will equate to 10 lorries less each day on the road.&nbsp;<br />\nThe plant will have a storage capacity of 300 tonnes of cement, and 240 tonnes of aggregates. CEMEX will be now able to increase production from 24m/h (at the existing Eversley plant) to 80m/h, while using a wet batch plant will ensure a better quality and strength of mix.<br />\nPeter Hawker, Operations Manager at CEMEX, commented: \u201cThis is a long-term investment by CEMEX into the Bramshill Quarry that will generate considerable benefits for our customers and the environment, for years to come.

D Heathcote covered the most distance in 60 minutes \u2013 45.19kms and H Gill covered the most distance in two one hour stints \u2013 83.76kms. J Berry managed an incredible 20.21kms using his hands and arms because he had recently had an operation on a delicate part of his body.&nbsp;Roger Taylor, Operations Manager for DSM, remarked he could not believe the commitment and effort every one of the volunteers put in to complete this event.<\/p>\n\n<p>They had a couple of malfunctions along the way: a bike wouldn\u2019t record the distance being travelled but luckily the company they hired the bikes from were quick to respond and brought them a replacement within three hours, and they also had a trouser malfunction but the less said about that the better!<\/p>\n\n<p>The Dove Holes team didn\u2019t only manage to get from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats, but they got over half way back again by completing an astonishing 2,296.62kms, that is an average of 35kms for each person.

        "Body": "<p>The collaboration has seen significant progress at both working and restored quarries. The summer months offer the best opportunity for spotting butterfly species at our sites. However, butterflies face many challenges with two thirds of species now showing population declines nationally. &nbsp;Butterflies are under threat due to a variety of reasons including climate change and extreme weather events, habitat destruction, intensive agricultural techniques, loss of wildflower meadows, wetland drainage schemes, removal of hedgerows and woodland clearance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite these clear pressures on butterfly populations, research by Butterfly Conservation has proven that with careful habitat design and habitat management, sites can mitigate against these events. CEMEX is at the forefront of implementing recommendations on their restored sites and have already had tremendous success in reversing population trends. &nbsp;Other land owners are now following their example with a definite feeling that we are turning the tide on the population declines.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Warwickshire with the help of Butterfly Conservation CEMEX was instrumental in first saving the Small Blue butterfly from regional extinction, but not content with this then reversed its fortunes. From the original three remaining Small Blue colonies which were all under threat, the number of colonies has now grown to 23, many of the colonies on CEMEX or former CEMEX sites. Warwickshire now has more colonies recorded than ever before. &nbsp;The work in Warwickshire has also helped conserve other rare butterflies including the Grizzled and Dingy Skippers, Dark Green Fritillary and Chalk Carpet Moth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Newly found<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Northumberland RSPB and CEMEX are working together at Divethill quarry preserving and creating the rare habitat called Whin grassland. &nbsp;During 2019 the Small Pearl-Bordered Fritillary was found on site. This was good news as the species is an important pollinator for the wildflower assemblage found in the grassland. Future restoration at the site will increase the area of rare grassland and include the addition of important native woodland fringes. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandgate quarry, Blue Adonis \u2013 The Blue Adonis is one of the UK\u2019s rarest butterflies and is found in only a few colonies doted along the south east coast. The butterfly has very specific requirements for its habitat including well cropped grass on a south facing meadow. &nbsp;The meadow also needs to support the butterfly\u2019s host plant which is Horseshoe Vetch. &nbsp;As part of the restoration work at Sandgate a habitat has been created that perfectly matches these requirements. With a colony already established at the nearby Cissbury Ring we have been lucky enough to attract this rare species to our site. During May 2019, a healthy population was discovered on site. Key measures going forward are to preserve the habitat and ensure the colony is protected. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopeful colonisers<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Raynes quarry in Wales is adjacent to Mynydd Marian SSSI which is home to a rare colony of Silver Studded Blue. RSPB and CEMEX have implemented a Biodiversity Action Plan to focus restoration work on habitat creation to improve the site for a bird species called the Chough, Wildflowers and the Silver-studded Blue butterfly. The quarry is developing a habitat called Calcareous grassland on restored areas of the site. This work has been ongoing for a number of years and utilised hay from the SSSI as a source of grass and wildflower seeds. The butterfly\u2019s main food plant is Common Rock Rose, which is now found on site. &nbsp;Surveys are carried out annually. &nbsp;To date, 2019 has shown that there are over 80 species flowering plant found in the grassland which already supports large and abundant butterfly populations. Some of the species found at the quarry this year included the Small White, Gatekeeper, Ringlet, Small Heath and also the Shaded Broad Bar Moth. The focus now is to encourage the Silver Studded Blue to site. The Chough continues to use the site for nesting and rearing its young during the summer months. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ancient woodland that flanks CEMEX Newbridge quarry in North Yorkshire is rich in Flora and Fauna and it is also home to the most northerly population of Duke of Burgundy, a tiny pretty butterfly whose food plant, Cowslip, grows in the areas of open woodland. Restoration has encouraged Cowslips to colonise the grassland-wood fringe and we are hopeful the Duke of Burgundy will follow soon.<\/p>"

The facility in Tilbury currently has approximately 2,800 employees but is set to increase to over 4,000. The Amazon KIVA robots are in operation at the facility and it was a joy to see how the robot was used. It was also interesting to hear that the robots were not a direct replacement for people but actually have created a requirement to employ more due to the efficiency of the robots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some key principles of the robot use were to improve storage effectiveness with a greater utilisation of floor space; by using the KIVA robot Amazon were able to store 40% more inventory. The CEMEX team were very interested to see how the health and safety was part of the robotic innovation. It was obvious that manual movements had been removed from this area of the process, eliminating all the risk associated with manual handling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Isolation was remarkably a lot more high-tech, the need for engineers to have access to the area where the robots were moving was essential due to the size of the facility. All engineering staff that required access, of which only two were trained per floor per shift, are issued a special type of vest which has an imbedded sensor, this sensor is picked up by any KIVA robot within five metres of the engineer and will immediately stop, once the engineer moves the KIVA robot will commence on its planned route.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Terence Clair, Operations Manager for Rail Solutions UK, said: \u201cIt was good to discuss some of the challenges faced around health and safety, with peoples\u2019 behaviours being a top topic for them much like ourselves. It is important to know that we choose to do things every day that have an impact or consequence, however, if we can think safety before we process the action we will reduce behavioural related accidents.\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Thanks to the conveyor belt bed in the trailer, there is no need for the truck to tip the clay out, which ensures there is no risk of truck rollover or collision with buildings if the body is not lowered. In addition, the driver can control the process by remote control from inside the cab \u2013 further increasing safety and minimising potential risk.<br />\nUsing these trailers also ensures a steady flow of clay from the truck into the reception hopper, reducing stress on the reception hopper and feeder. The belt trailer is also proven to discharge a load in the same amount of time as traditional tipper trucks.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, air vents in the trailer prevent the clay from sweating, while the stainless-steel body ensures a clean discharge of material, without any clay sticking.&nbsp;<br />\nBMD Transport, who were awarded a five-year contract with CEMEX to haul clay, has initially purchased two trucks from Fruehauf with plans to acquire an additional seven over the next year and replace the whole existing fleet for this route with the new models.&nbsp;<br />\nWhen the whole fleet has changed to these vehicles, there are further potential benefits; it could reduce the time to discharge each load, as drivers will not have to wait for the preceding load to have cleared the reception hopper before they start to deliver their load. This could then mean that CEMEX can increase the amount of clay brought from Southam each day.<br />\nLee Needham, Inbound Manager for UK Cement Operations at CEMEX, commented: \u201cWhen BMD presented these new trucks to us, we knew they would be a very positive addition to our fleet. Ensuring the safety of those who work for us and on our sites is of vital importance to CEMEX, and we are always looking for ways to improve our operation. These vehicles offer a very obvious safety benefit and meet FORS Silver standard, plus are also efficient and reliable. We look forward to working with BMD to replace the remainder of the fleet.\u201d<br />\nDec Chokar, Director at BMD Transport, added: \u201cThese new trucks are state of the art and have been specifically designed to be used for transporting clay. Eliminating the risk of truck rollover at point of discharge is of considerable benefit to CEMEX and will help to ensure they run a market-leading, safe operation.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:center\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">\u2013 ends \u2013<\/span><\/span> <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Notes to Editors:<\/span><\/span><\/b><b> <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">About CEMEX<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:list 36.0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

It provides real-time pricing during the design process to reduce cost<br />\nuncertainty and wasteful redesign efforts. It also standardizes material selection and works directly<br />\nwith suppliers to procure materials, eliminating submittals and lead-time delays. Their in-house<br />\nsoftware helps to manage the process end-to-end, simplifying the complexities of construction and<br />\nautomating most of the construction administration and accounting process.<br />\nAlthough X3 Builders was founded just over a year ago, the startup\u2019s employees boast vast<br />\nexperience in both the construction industry and the entrepreneurial world. The company started<br />\nout by exploring payment automation processes, and it went on to further develop its solution to<br />\ninclude the automation of the complete construction management process. Thanks to the team\u2019s<br />\nextensive experience in the field, they have been able to incorporate solutions to everyday needs.<br />\nBy having more data readily available and controlling the pre-construction phase, it\u2019s possible to<br />\nsimplify many of the subsequent processes in the project\u2019s life cycle and to reduce overall project<br />\ncosts. That is why so many property owners are willing to try this end-to-end solution, relying on the<br />\ntransparency and regional pricing data offered by X3 Builders.

        "Body": "<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first lorry safety scheme of its kind launches in London this week<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Direct Vision Standard seeks to eliminate dangerous Heavy Goods Vehicle blind spots, proven to be the cause of pedestrian and cyclist deaths and serious injuries<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HGVs that fail to meet new minimum safety standards will be issued a penalty charge for driving in the capital.<br />\nSadiq visited CEMEX\u2019s Stepney Concrete Plant today to see DVS lorries in action. All of the vehicles that CEMEX operates in London meet or exceed the minimum DVS requirements in place until 2024.<br />\n&nbsp;The first of its kind, the Direct Vision Standard tackles road danger at its source by minimising HGV blind spots which contribute to many tragic deaths and life-changing injuries. Based on how much a driver can see directly through their cab windows, the &nbsp;unique star system rates HGVs over 12 tonnes from zero (lowest) to five (highest). HGVs will need to meet a minimum \u2018one-star\u2019 rating by the time enforcement begins to enable them to operate in London, or will need to fit \u2018Safe System\u2019 measures to improve the vehicle\u2019s safety.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;Big lorries are disproportionately involved in fatal collisions. Whilst they account for just four per cent of the overall miles driven in the capital, between 2015 and 2017, HGVs were involved in 63 per cent of fatal collisions involving cyclists and 25 per cent involving pedestrians.<br />\n&nbsp;From this week, operators can apply for a HGV Safety Permit ahead of enforcement beginning on 26 October 2020. HGV operators who fail to meet these new minimum safety standards and obtain a permit will be issued a penalty charge for driving in the capital. The Direct Vision Standard will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will be enforced within the Greater London Boundary.&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:<\/strong> \u201cI\u2019m proud of our world-leading plans to remove the most dangerous lorries from London\u2019s streets. So many of the tragic deaths on our roads involve HGVs and this new scheme will help save lives.<br />\n\u201cForward-looking businesses have already been choosing safer vehicles in the run up to HGV safety permits becoming available. Today the scheme has gone live and operators now have 12 months to upgrade their fleets, helping make our streets much safer for people walking and cycling.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>David Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK, commented:<\/strong> \u201cWe were honoured to welcome Sadiq Khan and the TfL team to our Stepney site today, as the Direct Vision Standard is launched. DVS is a landmark scheme that will ensure that all road users and pedestrians are safe as they come across HGVs while moving around the city. We fully support the programme; safety is CEMEX\u2019s number one priority and informs all aspects of our operation.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are committed to investing in, and developing, our fleet so that it continues to reflect the latest advancements in safety features. In the UK, we are proud to be a FORS Gold operator and compliant with the CLOCS standard, and are just as committed to the Direct Vision Standard for HGVs. We look forward to continuing to work with the Mayor, TfL and London councils for safer roads and streets here in London and beyond.\u201d<br />\nOwners of vehicles rated zero-star will need to improve the overall safety of their vehicle by fitting a \u2018Safe System\u2019 to reduce the risk it presents to people walking, cycling and riding motorcycles before enforcement begins. These include a camera monitoring system, a noise alert when turning left and sensors. Fitting the \u2018Safe System\u2019 will not improve a vehicle's DVS star rating but will bring the safety standard of the vehicle up to allow operators to apply for a Safety Permit.<br />\n&nbsp;TfL worked closely with manufacturers, operators and stakeholders - including RoadPeace and Living Streets - to develop the Direct Vision Standard.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;At the same time as the Direct Vision Standard is brought into force, requirements for the London-wide Low Emission Zone will be tightened so that heavy vehicles across the capital are subject to the tough ULEZ standards. These changes show the vital role the freight industry will play in both tackling road danger and cleaning up the capital\u2019s toxic air. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Christina Calderato, Head of Transport Strategy and Planning, said: <\/strong>\u201cToday we have reached a major milestone in a scheme that will save people\u2019s lives and play a significant role in helping us achieve Vision Zero. Transforming the safety of HGVs will dramatically reduce road danger for people walking and cycling, helping us to ensure that everyone gets home safely every day. We would like to encourage all operators to check the star rating of their vehicles and take action today, by applying for a permit or fitting a Safe System.\u201d<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Councillor Julian Bell, Chair of the London Councils Transport and Environment Committee, said: <\/strong>&nbsp;\u201cLondon boroughs support the launch of Direct Vision Standard Safety Permits for HGVs using London\u2019s roads. This is a huge step forward for road safety in the capital. &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\u201cEnsuring lorry drivers have good levels of visibility will better protect vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. Increasing the number of people who walk and cycle in the capital is vital to improving our air quality and reducing congestion. We look forward to the new scheme having a positive impact on the safety of London\u2019s road network.\u201d &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Victoria Lebrec, Campaign Coordinator for RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said: <\/strong>\u201cI lost my leg in a crash with a lorry in 2014 because the driver didn\u2019t see me. Since then there have been many people killed and even more seriously injured because the lorries currently driving on London roads are not fit for purpose. It is madness to have huge, heavy vehicles with poor visibility on roads that are filled with people. Transport for London should be commended for their Safety Permit scheme. I look forward to October 2020 when the most dangerous vehicles will be off the roads \u2013 and in the meantime encourage operators to consider thinking ahead, and making their vehicles five stars.\u201d<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Stephen Edwards, Director of Policy and Communications, Living Streets said:<\/strong> \"Despite making up just four per cent of London\u2019s motor traffic, HGVs are involved in more than a fifth of pedestrian fatalities. The threat they pose to our safety has not been acceptable for a long time.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\u201cThe Direct Vision Standard is a much-needed scheme which stands to save many lives. By implementing this world-first innovation, the Mayor of London demonstrates his commitment to creating a city safer for walking and ensures London remains one of the world\u2019s leading cities.\u201d<br />\nLoughborough University researchers have been instrumental in bringing the Direct Vision Standard to where it is today, having defined and tested the scheme. &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Dr Steve Summerskill, Senior Lecturer at Loughborough University, said: <\/strong>\u201cThis successful project is the result of the efforts of a number of staff in the Loughborough Design School, who have worked as a team to produce an innovate and accurate testing technique that has been validated by vehicle manufacturers. The result will have a beneficial effect on the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in the UK capital and further afield. An impact assessment performed by TRL (Transport Research Laboratory) on behalf of the EU showed that European adoption would save hundreds of lives per year.\u201d<br />\nTfL is working with the UK Government, European Commission and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to develop international regulations on vehicle design standards.&nbsp;<br />\nThe Direct Vision Standard is part of TfL's Vision Zero commitment to tackle the number of people being killed and seriously injured on London's roads.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information please contact Sarah Murphy at <a href=\"mailto:sarah.murphy@cemex.com\">sarah.murphy@cemex.com<\/a>&nbsp;or 07557 319972<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>It was named as the overall winner of the Planned Biodiversity-led Restoration category.<br />\nThe MPA praised the plan as a fantastic example of progressive restoration of a rock quarry to create an attractive landform and a mosaic of species-rich, locally important and distinctive \u2018Whin\u2019 grassland, agricultural grassland, woodland and hedges, and open water. The judges were impressed by the clear plan to deliver a range of habitats and realise the unique opportunity presented by quarrying to deliver regional priorities and wider landscape-scale benefits.<br />\nDonald Wilkins, Development Planner, said: \u201cThrough early engagement with the Northumberland Wildlife Trust, the RSPB, Northumberland County Council and Magnificent Meadows, it was clear that the restoration at Divethill Quarry provided an opportunity to create new areas of species rich grasslands and whin grasslands, both of which have been in decline over the past few decades.\u201d<br />\n\u201cCEMEX is delighted to have won the \u2018Planned Biodiversity-led Restoration\u2019 and will continue to work with our partner organisations to maximise the benefits from the restoration of our quarries.\u201d<br />\nThe restoration plan is to create a grassland with whin ridge/escarpment and outcrops (locally named as \u2018heughs\u2019) within a mosaic of species-rich grasslands with subtly varying soil types. Additionally, native woodland to the south and a small waterbody will add diversity and act as a hub for wildlife (both local and on passage). Whin grasslands are closely associated with the \u2018Great Whin Sill\u2019 a quartz dolerite intrusion upon which Hadrian\u2019s Wall is located.<br />\nThe thin soils found there are base-rich but nutrient-poor and prone to drought, which has led to the development of a species-rich sward, a composite of both acid- and alkali-loving plants. Whole hosts of specialist wildflowers and numerous red listed upland birds and mammals and national scarce species can be found; maiden pink, wild onion, biting stonecrop, common rock-rose, wild thyme, salad burnet, the locally scarce small-flowered and long-stalked crane\u2019s-bills. Birds and mammals include brown hare, peregrine, yellowhammer, linnet, curlew and whinchat.<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX decided to collaborate with the RSPB in 2009 because of the organisation\u2019s huge conservation knowledge, experience and expertise, and scale and willingness to work in a trusted partnership, to lead the industry in terms of biodiversity and conservation efforts.<br />\nThis relationship prioritised the conservation of rare and endangered species on CEMEX land. Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) are now in place at high priority CEMEX sites, with new projects being started at other quarries.&nbsp;<br />\nThese BAPs incorporate varied actions that improve ecosystem services and create space for rewilding, presenting opportunities for working alongside NGOs to develop species rich habitats.<br />\nAlongside the 1000 hectares of restored habitat, other achievements of the partnership so far have included work at four central England sites to create habitat and a sustainable food source for the turtle dove, which is the country\u2019s fastest-declining bird species; and efforts to protect the rare red-billed chough at its Raynes quarry.<br />\nStandout restoration projects have received nationwide acclaim, such as the Rugeley heathland and Lade Pits quarry in Kent.<br />\nCEMEX will continue to work closely with the RSPB towards a series of further targets for priority species conservation and priority habitat creation. The company will also work on improved engagement and awareness with employees, customers and communities.&nbsp;<br />\nAndy Spencer, VP of Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX Europe said: \u201cWe are very proud of our partnership with the RSPB, and what has been achieved over the last 10 years. Not only have we restored a considerable amount of priority habitat across the country together, two years ahead of schedule, but we have also helped a number of rare species.<br />\n\u201cConservation is one of the key parts of our ongoing sustainability strategy and this partnership is critical for us to delivery ongoing net gain in biodiversity across our extraction sites so when we complete our work, we are giving more back to society and the environment than was there to start with.<br />\n\u201cIn the future, the partnership needs to continue to deliver high quality, high priority habitats to help combat the decline in biodiversity that we\u2019ve seen in the UK, as well as strengthen our partnership into ongoing advocacy and supporting each other to achieve our common goals. We are excited to see what we can achieve together over the next 10 years!\u201d<br />\nBeccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, commented: \u201cWorking in partnership with CEMEX we have shown how land can be transformed from being an active quarry into a vibrant home for wildlife and we hope that our experience inspires others to play their part in restoring nature.<br />\n\u201cOur natural world is in crisis, but by restoring or creating habitats we can often reverse local population declines of threatened species, keeping our common species common and expanding the number of safe havens our wildlife needs across the UK.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cIn addition to providing urgently needed new habitat for threatened species the former quarry sites are also providing communities with accessible green spaces and connecting people to nature. Together we are delivering practical examples of how the way we manage our land can see nature return. &nbsp;Going forward we will continue to demonstrate how business and conservation can work together to make a positive difference and ensure the variety of our wonderful species can be sustained in a way which also benefits people.\u201d<br />\nThe anniversary of the partnership was celebrated at Petersham Nurseries in Covent Garden.

They often spend an hour or two on a quarry pond or in a restored wetland before moving off to the coast to feed on salt marsh and coastal farmland. These birds spend the winter moving between estuaries in the east and west, traveling from The Wash to the Forth of Firth and always flying in that classic aerodynamic V formation.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nImage credit: Tim Melling<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The rating upgrade reflects CEMEX\u2019s improvement in governance, risk management, CO2 emissions reduction initiatives, low carbon products, and value chain engagement.<br />\n\"We are very pleased not only that our CDP score has improved, but also that it reflects our company\u2019s continued effort to achieve a robust climate change strategy, which is helping us to reduce our operations\u2019 CO2 footprint. So far, we have reduced our net specific emissions per ton of cementitious product by more than 22% when compared to our 1990 baseline, putting us on track to accomplish our ambitious science-based targets for 2030,\u201d said Vicente Saiso, Corporate Sustainability Director of CEMEX.<br />\nTo date, CEMEX has reduced its direct CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious product by more than 22% compared to its 1990 baseline, allowing the company to avoid approximately 8 million tons of CO2 during 2019, equivalent to the carbon emissions of 1.6 million passenger vehicles.<br />\nCEMEX is taking the following steps to further reduce its direct CO2 emissions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Producing new types of low CO2 clinker, cement, and concrete products<\/li>\n\t<li>Increasing our use of alternative fuels as a substitute for fossil fuels<\/li>\n\t<li>Using waste from other industries as alternative raw materials as a substitute for clinker<\/li>\n\t<li>Expanding and protecting natural carbon sinks from our El Carmen Nature Reserve to all of our quarries<\/li>\n\t<li>Developing and testing disruptive technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and other innovative carbon technologies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>CEMEX is also determined to reduce indirect CO2 emissions from electricity through the company\u2019s use of renewable energy. Close to 30% of CEMEX\u2019s power consumption is covered by renewable energy sources, the highest rate among global cement companies.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nCDP is a not-for-profit international organization that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. Over the past 15 years, CDP has created a system that has resulted in unparalleled engagement on environmental issues worldwide.

        "Summary": "A new, £3.8million dry discharge system at CEMEX\u2019s Northfleet Wharf in Kent has been officially opened. The building materials supplier partnered with the Port of London Authority on the investment, which will ensure a more sustainable and flexible operation.",

        "Display Title": "CEMEX and PLA Officially Open New Dry Discharge System at Northfleet Wharf",
        "Body": "<p>Following this investment CEMEX\u2019s marine dredgers, which bring sand and gravel from CEMEX\u2019s licensed offshore locations in the North Sea and the English Channel into Northfleet, will be able to arrive fully laden for the first time. This will increase capacity of the site by approximately 350,000 tonnes per year to between 800,000 and 850,000 tonnes.<br />\nThis will allow CEMEX to provide more material to its on-site building products plant, reducing the need for aggregates to be transported in from other locations. This offers considerable sustainability benefits, as every dredger load reduces the need for 250 lorries on the region\u2019s busy roads.&nbsp;<br />\nPrior to this investment, the wharf at Northfleet was the only wet discharge system remaining in CEMEX\u2019s UK portfolio, and was prone to blockages and limited the products and capacity that could be brought into site. The new dry discharge system will increase the reliability and flexibility of the wharf, reducing the risk of blockages and ensuring ships can bring in exactly the right materials needed. The site can therefore better balance stocks and ensure quality, providing CEMEX\u2019s customers with an improved service.&nbsp;<br />\nLaurence Dagley, CEMEX UK Materials South\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cWe are grateful for our positive relationship with the PLA, and thankful for their support. Not only will this investment allow us to better serve the London market, opening up opportunities for growth and securing the future of the wharf, but it also promises a considerable sustainability benefit by taking trucks off the road.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX\u2019s UK strategy focuses on London and the other metropolitan markets across the country, as we believe increasing urbanisation will drive greater demand growth in these markets. It is therefore vital that our sites in these areas are developed to ensure they can support this strategy.<br />\n\u201cThanks to the funding from PLA, we have been able to invest our own resources into other assets, such as CEMEX Go Innovation, our state-of-the-art marine dredger which will arrive in the UK later this year.\u201d<br />\nRobin Mortimer, PLA chief executive, said: \u201cThis investment is central to our long-term Thames Vision work to maximise the use of tidal river between Teddington and the coast, for both freight and passenger transport.<br />\n\u201cOur aim is to do this whilst also protecting the environment and making the most of the river\u2019s social and recreational potential. Crucially, this conveyor also generates a commercial return for us, which we will be re-invest in other projects to enhance the river, for the benefit of all its users and the environment at large.\u201d<br />\nLocal MP Adam Holloway attended the opening event, commenting: \u201cIt is genuinely an honour to cut the ribbon on this wonderful project, which is such a great collaboration between the PLA and CEMEX. The river has always been a mainstay of Gravesham\u2019s economy and this very welcome new investment is vital to protecting its future as a source of employment for local people. It\u2019s also contributing towards the work the nation needs to undertake to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.<br />\n\u201cI congratulate both the PLA and CEMEX for showing such leadership on this issue.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

I facilitated idea generation and helped steer each group to work together to present their idea.\u201d<br />\nJazz continues: \u201cThese sessions are incredibly rewarding for the students and business mentors. I cannot express enough the satisfaction I get from the various events. &nbsp;They provide me with guidance and offer a wider thinking to the younger generation that I never had access to whilst at school/college.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"I am booked for further upcoming events and include \u201cUniversity, is this the path?\u201d (options of university, careers and considerations of other industry qualifications), and, of course, CEMEX gets a great mention!!!!\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Spring is nearly here and it\u2019s very welcome after the long winter months. Sean Cassidy and colleagues will soon be getting on with the job of monitoring wildlife as required by the Biodiversity Action Plans.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sean explains: \u201cWe get a lot of help from CEMEX staff, the RSPB, several NGOs (e.g. Butterfly Conservation, Wildlife Trusts) and visitors to our sites. We are very grateful for the help and enthusiasm we\u2019ve received over the last year. I have prepared a summary of 2019 which was another good year. &nbsp;This subject is becoming more important for the business because of changes to UK law requiring Biodiversity Net Gain and also because it links to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2019 Summary:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>69 species of birds on the red or amber lists were spotted in our quarries in 2019. Our Twite project at Dove Hole quarry continues to help prevent this species from going extinct in England.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites are also important habitats for insects especially as we don\u2019t use pesticides. Bumblebees were present at all of our sites with BAPs and some rarer solitary bees were also spotted. Some sites found nearly 70 species of insect. Of the UK butterfly species 70% of them were spotted at CEMEX sites during 2019. &nbsp;The rarest find was a Blind Cave Spider in the lesser Garth Cave at Taffs Well quarry \u2013 this spider is an IUCN listed species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites are also home to many mammals. With 14 sites housing badgers, 12 have spotted brown hares and two sites are home to our largest mammals \u2013 red deer. &nbsp;Mammal populations in the UK are in decline so it\u2019s important for our BAPs to focus on projects designed to help them such as the Dormouse \u2013 found at only one of our sites in 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Legally protected amphibians and reptiles are also present at many of our sites. The best site for spotting reptiles is West Heath in Sussex as they\u2019ve created specialist hibernacula and spotted Adders, Grass Snakes, Slow Worms and the Common Lizard.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wildflower diversity at some quarries is exceptional. We have three quarries with over 100 species, these are helped by the presence of pollinators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fungi are regularly spotted at our sites as they need undisturbed land to thrive. They play a vital role in the ecosystem by breaking down biomass and putting nutrients back into the soil.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our BAPs help us create many different types of habitats across our sites and stakeholder engagement is also key to our success. For example, in the summer of 2019 a Butterfly Day at one of our \u2018mothballed\u2019 quarries in Fife, Scotland was held. &nbsp;We worked with the local community and the Scottish Butterfly Conservation Society to spot butterflies. &nbsp;They managed to spot 128 species in all, including wildflowers and 12 species of butterfly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites continue to provide a haven for British wildlife and create important spaces in which we can encourage and support some of the rarest plants and animals.<\/p>"

But we acknowledge that this is not enough. This is why we have defined a more ambitious target of a 35% reduction of net specific CO2 emissions by 2030. This new goal is aligned with the Science-Based Targets methodology, a requirement climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.<\/p>\n\n<p>To complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX is also establishing a new ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050. In our business, we believe concrete\u2014our end product\u2014has a key role to play in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy, and is an essential component in the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings, and resilient infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cClimate change has been a priority for CEMEX for many years. Our efforts have brought significant progress to date, but we must do more. This is why we have defined a more ambitious strategy to reduce CO2 emissions by 2030 and to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050,\u201d said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>To fulfill this strategy, we have a detailed CO2 roadmap to accelerate the roll-out of proven technologies in all of our facilities, including investing in energy efficiency, using alternative fuels, expanding the use of renewable energy, and increasing the substitution of clinker with alternative cementitious materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, our new net-zero CO2 concrete aspiration for 2050 sets us on a path of open innovation that requires strategic partnerships and cross-industry collaboration in the development of breakthrough technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage; novel clinkers with low heat consumption, alternative decarbonated raw materials, carbonation of concrete waste for use as recycled aggregates, and the promotion of circular economy models that transform waste into fuel. CEMEX currently consumes as either alternative fuel or alternative raw material 32 times more waste from other industries than the waste it generates and sends to landfill.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information on the company\u2019s new Climate Action strategy, please visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.com/en/sustainability/climate-action\">https://www.cemex.com/en/sustainability/climate-action<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>RAF Coningsby is one of the UK\u2019s Quick Reaction Alert Stations which protect UK airspace. It is the home of two frontline, combat-ready squadrons and the main base for the RAF\u2019s Typhoon fighter aircraft. CEMEX\u2019s Lincoln coating plant provided the asphalt over five months as a key part of the prestigious runway resurfacing project.&nbsp;<br />\nA specific challenge of this project was the requirement for the site to always remain fully operational, so the Typhoons could be scrambled in case of an emergency. As a result, contractor Colas resurfaced a short section of the runway each night. CEMEX provided a Porous Friction Course to meet the Ministry of Defence\u2019s complex asphalt specifications, supplying up to 450 tonnes per shift.&nbsp;<br />\nJames Playford, Area Manager for Asphalt, commented: \u201cMeeting the requirements of this project required exceptional teamwork, and I am very proud of my colleagues and what we have achieved. Initially, we were only expecting to supply the surface course material, however once the job had started the binder course layers also had to be replaced, which greatly increased the amount of product needed.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cTherefore, coordination between several different areas of the business was vital. Our aggregates team at Roan Edge Quarry was the only site that could supply us with the required premium quality hardstone and so had to work under considerable pressure; the technical team ensured we met the product specification; the sales team engaged with Colas; while the operational team fulfilled every single order to time, keeping the plant running day and night throughout the project.<br />\n\u201cWe wanted Colas to be reassured from the start of this high-profile scheme that we were the right supplier for this project, with the resources to create the perfect product. We carried out extensive mix testing and laying trials, as well providing a full operational capability tour of the asphalt plant. This comprehensive and dedicated approach paid off and we are pleased the project has been such a success.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX worked for UK infrastructure contractor Colas on the project. Procurement Manager Steve Bryant commented: \u201cWe were very impressed by CEMEX\u2019s collaborative approach, which ensured they could meet the intricate specificities of the project in the constrained timeframe. The finished runaway is a quality surface that will play a key part in this site\u2019s defence work. All of the CEMEX employees involved should be very proud.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>Roger Taylor, DSM Ops Manager commented, \u201cTo gain access to the site you have to get through 6 locked gates and we sometimes have drivers sleep in their cabs overnight. Kevin Hyams, Dry Silo Engineer, recognized the hazard of drivers being locked in and raised a NMHA card.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Roger had another concern that a post code for the Quarry did not exist and was worried that the Fire Brigade would not know where to go in a real emergency.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, he invited Essex Fire and Rescue to the plant so that they could update their response file to the site. The file automatically gets displayed in the cab of the Fire engines in an emergency and this will notify the Fire Fighters of any instructions on how to enter the site and any harmful or flammable products on site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Paul Adams Fire Chief for Braintree fire station was very impressed with our emergency readiness and asked if they could carry out a Confined Rescue drill, one to test their response and two to test our procedures. The idea was that only Paul knew the layout of the plant and what we were intending to do, the rest of the team just knew it was a training drill but didn\u2019t know what to expect including getting through 6 locked gates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lee Liggan, Plant Manager for Braintree DSM prepared the silo before the Fire Brigade got there and lowered a dummy down under controlled circumstances. Lee was also the first contact when the Fire Brigade got on site, it is crucial the first contact gives clear and precise information on what has happened to minimise any reaction times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though Roger had organised the rescue with the Brigade, he couldn\u2019t believe how many people and machines needed to turn out to rescue one person. Roger commented \u201cWe had two fire engines, a truck loaded with specialist rescue equipment, a ALP (Articulated Lifting Platform), a hazardous material response truck and numerous other vehicles. It was very impressive to see how everyone knew their job, their own procedures were obviously very well drilled, no one was allowed in/out of the building without being checked in/out, instructions were clearly communicated, their equipment was the best you can get.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing that surprised Roger was how long it took to get set up and ensure all controls were in place before a rescue person was allowed to enter the Confined Space and attend to the injured party, in a real situation this would feel like an eternity. But this is the same of our \u201cStop and Think\u201d ensuring all hazards have been identified and controls put in place before continuing. Roger concludes by saying that \u201cthere is no point attempting to save someone if the rescuer is going to get hurt.\u201d<\/p>"

Salford has benefited from having the railway line near, as these can act as wildlife corridors in heavily built up areas.&nbsp;<br />\nIf you offer the birds some food using a seed feeder or bird table keep this within easy reach for them, with just a hop from a bush or tree as&nbsp;the birds then feel safer and less vulnerable to predators and are more likely to use your feeder. Goldfinches are one of the species that are doing well and coping with changes in the environment and climate. They are generalists and well adapted to take advantage of bird feeders.&nbsp;<br />\nIf you\u2019d never seen the bird before you\u2019d wonder why&nbsp;this bird is called a Goldfinch, with its distinctive red and black face, but it opens up a beautiful fringed, fan of golden feathers when you see one fly away.<\/p>\n\n<p>RSPB\u2019s BGBW is all about monitoring using your observations in citizen science to work out what is happening nationally to bird numbers so we can spot when a species or suite of birds is in trouble.&nbsp; If you would like to find out more, visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch/results/\">https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch/results/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In these strange times, whilst we all need to stay home and stay safe, take time to watch the birds in your garden, put up a feeder and find the enjoy in bringing wildlife closer to you.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX have been partners with the RSPB for over 10 years, working together to help wildlife at their sites is just one aspect of the partnership.&nbsp;<br />\nImage credit: Tim Melling<\/p>"

Shortly after, the construction chemicals specialists will produce a stock for six months. Moreover, CEMEX personnel are supporting pharmacies and hospitals in purchasing raw materials. As all CEMEX sites in Europe will soon be equipped with sanitiser, the company plans to play an increasingly important role in supporting local communities by providing much needed disinfectants. Sanitisers will also be made available to customers on a cost base only.<\/p>\n\n<p>Marcelo Catala, CEMEX Europe VP of Urbanization Solutions at CEMEX, emphasizes: \u201cWe have extraordinary talent, creativity and expertise in our Teams; scale to leverage\u2026 and above all the determination to put our teamwork and solutions at the service of our Colleagues and the Communities in which we operate. New products in our offer reflect our engagement to local environmental dynamics and urbanization needs\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Admixtures plants usually produce construction chemicals such as air-entraining agents, water reducers, concrete retarders, accelerators and superplasticizers. Therefore, the production facility in question and its specialist staff are well positioned to ensure safety and quality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The formulations are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for relatively simple, local production. ISOCLEAN WHO 1 is an alcoholic solution containing 70 to 80% ethanol. The reagents are ethanol 96%, hydrogen peroxide 3%, glycerol 98%, and sterile distilled or boiled cold water. The second formulation, ISOCLEAN WHO 2, is based on 70 to 80% propan-2-ol. In this instance, the alcohol component is isopropyl alcohol 99.8% instead of ethanol. In both cases, the potent disinfectant mixture is supplied in 5-litre containers together with a user manual and safety instructions. Hand sanitisers in the form of gel or liquid are particularly effective and work quickly.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX Europe\u2019s cross-divisional Rapid Response Team is working in close coordination with the company\u2019s headquarters in Mexico as well as colleagues on several continents. \u201cWe share our findings so that they can be leveraged by our international colleagues as quickly as possible,\u201d explains Marcelo Catala. \u201cWe hope that our efforts will help keep our employees and our external stakeholders safe.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about CEMEX, please contact Sarah Murphy: <a href=\"mailto:sarah.murphy@cemex.com\">sarah.murphy@cemex.com<\/a>&nbsp;or call 07557 319972<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

The site is being restored to heathland; which is a high priority habitat for the area. &nbsp;Wildlife such as the adder, grass snake and common lizard, as well as rare and red listed birds such as the dartford warbler, nightjar and woodlark all benefit from this kind of habitat. Once restored the site will form part of a wider network of heath and woodland mosaics that includes Cannock Chase.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nOvertime the site has become dominated by bracken and bramble with scrub starting to encroach, without undertaking vital management the heathland would be lost, and these priority species will lose their home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A site visit to Rugeley took place in early March, before physical distancing, with Alex Finn from the CEMEX Restoration Team; Gareth Fenna, Quarry Manager; Jenny Oldroyd, RSPB Partnership Advisor; Jaclyn Lake, Natural England; and Wesley Parnell, RSPB heathland management team, to make an initial overview assessment of the heath\u2019s management needs. It was a really positive visit with all parties keen to work together. The weather was kind and the warm spring sunshine gave some great wildlife sightings too, with Woodlark calling, Goshawk seen and even Adder giving us a hiss, as we accidentally disturbed it, before sliding off and vanishing under the bracken.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX are working in-partnership with the RSPB, and liaising with Natural England, to pull together a plan to manage the adjacent land that is part of the SAC. This plan will be a long-term commitment by CEMEX; the vision is to bring back a more diverse structure to the heath; reduce bracken cover and manage scrub. This is going to be challenging in such an open area. With the first phase being a survey to identify which areas to prioritise management and to identify wildlife that use the site. After which a management plan will be drafted, and the vital management work started.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: Dartford Warbler taken by Tim Melling.<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Keeping happy and healthy both physically and mentally is key to how we bounce back out of this situation, as gradually restrictions are lifted. This is also true of our children - many parents will talk of children having cabin fever - there are well documented connections between spending time outdoors in nature and our feelings of wellbeing.<\/p>\n\n<p>During lockdown lots of people are seeing wildlife in their gardens, many are noticing more about nature locally whilst working from home, either in their gardens or on daily exercise. &nbsp;To encourage this, our partner the RSPB runs a programme called Wild Challenge \u2013 an opportunity for people to connect with the natural world in brave new ways \u2013 to reach out and touch it and meet it head-on, up-close and personal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Three of the leaders from across the UK business took part in the Wild Challenge, and hopefully this will encourage you and your families to participate too! Find out more below\u2026<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve Redwood, Land Development and Permitting Director for Europe, is on lockdown in rural Cambridgeshire with his family \u2013 three boys. Like many others he has been making the most of the weather and helping his children connect with nature on his doorstep for daily lockdown exercise and to fight off cabin fever!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve decided to participate in the RSPB\u2019s Wild Challenge with his youngest son, Harry (eight years old), by combining a birdwatching wildlife walk with sowing wildflowers for bees. They walked around the local farmers\u2019 fields looking for birds, insects and basically anything moving!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve says: \u201cOur walk took us around the local field boundaries; we saw hedge sparrows, a pair of Red Kites who nest in the local woodland being chased by three or four crows and on adjacent lakes we could see a pair of nesting swans. My son was particularly interested in the badger sett we saw by the woodland and discussed why we did not see any badgers during the day. On our way home we walked past a pond and saw a grass snake (well I think it was?) swimming across the pond.<\/p>\n\n<p>At home we sowed some wildflower seeds on a patch of open land in our garden. We used some wildflower seeds bound in clay that you throw on the prepared ground (raked over and watered) - called Beebombs which are great for kids and very easy to sow. We discussed the importance of wildflowers for bees and how important bees are for the countryside, biodiversity and their role in the ecosystems. Adding a nectar corner, full of flowers for bees, butterflies, hoverflies is a really rewarding way to add more colour to the garden and help nature.&nbsp;<br />\nWe had a really enjoyable day and have done a little to help wildlife. We had some quality time together outside, and quite an exciting and interesting afternoon!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, CEMEX Managing Director UK Materials Lex Russell, is on lockdown in Edinburgh with his older son and Lex decided to take part in the RSPB\u2019s Wild Challenge, by looking for Signs of Spring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Lex commented: \u201cThe changes to all of our lives that the COVID pandemic has brought have been unprecedented. &nbsp;My personal situation found me in lockdown in Edinburgh sharing a flat with no garden with my eldest son. The challenges of work during the crisis were some of the most extreme that I have ever endured. Very quickly it became apparent that during lockdown I needed to look after both my physical and mental wellbeing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Working with the RSPB I have developed a great passion for engaging with nature in our quarries and sites, so the \u201cfirst signs of spring\u201d initiative seemed like a good opportunity for me, to let nature help me maintain my overall wellbeing. &nbsp;My highlight is the early morning walks along the Water of Leith listening to the dawn chorus and smelling the aroma of the wildflowers. &nbsp;This gave me the inspiration to deal with all of the challenges I had to face in a working day.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>It can be hard to find green space in the heart of a cities, but parks and communal gardens are a place to start, with rivers sides and canal paths being richer in nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nLex:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listened to the dawn chorus.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listened to a bird in full song.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looked for spring - finding the first flowers.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Found the first trees coming into leaf.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Watched for invertebrates- butterflies and pollinators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, Andy Spencer, VP Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for the EMEAA Region, took part in a Wild Challenge is his back garden \u2013 going on a bug safari!<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy is spending lockdown at home with his family in Leicestershire and taking time out in his garden has given him the opportunity to check in on the two bee and bug hotels he installed a few years ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy says: \u201cThe bee and bug hotels have been a very easy way to encourage more wildlife into our garden \u2013 it was literally just a case of hanging them up on the fence! I installed a couple of them about three years ago, both on a south facing fence at the bottom of the garden, near to a tree and some Laurel bushes.<\/p>\n\n<p>We had to be patient at first but in the second year we started to notice the holes being filled and then in springtime a frenzy of activity during the day. They are now used a lot by solitary bees. One of the bee hotels has different spaces for insects and we have seen lacewings and other insects around it.<br />\nI definitely think we have seen more bees in the garden as a result. Although it is a small garden, we have a few miniature fruit trees and we seem to be getting better pollination and more fruit over the past couple of years. We have also noticed last year and this year several ground nesting bee nests \u2013 and the bees are not aggressive at all so no fear for the kids!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see from these three examples, wherever we are spending lockdown there are still plenty of opportunities to get out and experience nature. &nbsp;If you\u2019d like to take part in your own Wild Challenge, click through the link below:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-families/family-wild-challenge/\">https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-families/family-wild-challenge/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Products that can reduce the use of additional materials and equipment and working in confined spaces, while allowing effective use of labour and maintaining physical distance guidelines are likely to be of increased demand as construction resumes.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Options from CEMEX to support these requirements include high performance concrete solutions, mortars and its digital platform CEMEX Go.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">For example, Evolution™, CEMEX\u2019s self-compacting concrete range, which can spread into place, fill formwork, and encapsulate even the most congested reinforcement by means of its own weight, with little or no vibration. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">This self-compacting concrete is ideal for casting heavily reinforced sections or can be placed where there can be no access to vibrators for compaction and in complex shapes of formwork which may otherwise be impossible to cast, giving a far superior surface to conventional concrete.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">As self-compacting concrete can flow from a single point* it is self-levelling, self-compacting and eliminates the need to hire expensive vibration equipment or use additional labour. This offers both health &amp; safety and cost benefits. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Additionally, the Advanced fibre reinforced concretes, a range of fibre reinforced ready-mix concretes, containing a blend of polypropylene micro fibres and engineered macro fibre or steel fibre solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">There are many features of fibre reinforced concrete, however the main one is the reduction or elimination of crack control steel mesh. This provides a number of benefits, including a reduction in material delivered, stored and handled on site and the minimisation of labour required for cutting and placing steel reinforcement. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Rapid hardening concrete, such as CEMEX\u2019s Promptis, can also help save valuable time during construction. Promptis has similar characteristics to conventional concrete but it can reach accelerated early strength after just six hours while still maintaining initial flow properties and consistence for up to 120 minutes. Formwork can be stripped after only six hours (subject to mix design and guidance). Benefits of this type of product include increased productivity, cost savings and removal of on-site delays.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Meanwhile, CEMEX\u2019s factory produced mortars offer clean, efficient production with reduced wastage and increased productivity on site. CEMEX can provide dry mortar in a silo, ready-to-use wet mortar and dry bagged mortar, meaning there is a solution available whatever the size of the site or requirements of the job. The dry silo systems also reduce manual handling and the risk of injury in production, for improved health and safety. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Finally, the CEMEX Go digital platform allows customers to easily order online, whatever their location. This means they can manage their account quickly and efficiently, including tracking deliveries, receiving digital invoices, placing and amending orders, without having to be in the office. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Richard Kershaw, Technical Manager for CEMEX Materials UK, commented: \u201cWith safe working on site paramount and physical distancing guidelines still in effect, products that minimise labour, contribute to physical distance and reduce additional materials or equipment on site whilst simultaneously maximising productivity are now essential.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">\u201cWe therefore wanted to identify and highlight which of our products and services would be of most use to our customers in this regard. Using a self-levelling concrete, or our digital ordering platform for instance, can ease the challenge of meeting public health guidelines while continuing operations, ensuring a safe yet productive site. As a business, CEMEX continues to provide a full service as it has done throughout the pandemic and we are ready to meet our customers\u2019 needs and support their projects, whatever the requirements.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about the products and services CEMEX offers to help customers meet site working requirements, visit <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/physical-distancing-on-construction-sites\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/physical-distancing-on-construction-sites<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<br />\n* &nbsp;On large pours more than one point may be required<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>VIAPATH can be laid between 25mm and 70mm thick, eliminating the need for multi-layer surfacing which can be costly \u2013 both in terms of the materials and labour required. It also presents significant time savings, which helps to limit the disruption to pedestrians and other road users and achieve a faster rate of job completion. In addition, multi-layer construction can often lead to damage in underlying layers resulting in further delays and spiralling costs.<br />\nFor those looking to incorporate more eco-friendly products into their construction projects, VIAPATH offers real sustainability benefits. It achieves a carbon footprint reduction for a project by requiring less fuel use during the paving operation, less tack coat/bond coat and lower on-site wastage.&nbsp;<br />\nA further benefit of this single layer solution is that it addresses a common cause of potholes caused by traditional pavement construction. Typically, a horizontal joint would be required between the binder course and surface course layers which presents an inherent risk to the ingress of water. With VIAPATH this joint is eliminated, thus improving the overall structural durability of the pavement.<br />\nMartin Ashfield, Technical Manager for Asphalt &amp; Paving, CEMEX Europe, commented: \u201cAs more and more of us adapt to new ways of sustainable travelling that also eases pressure on public transport, the development of cycle and footpaths is critical.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cFortunately, VIAPATH is a premium-quality asphalt solution that has been specifically designed to replace surface, regulating or binder courses in a single pass. This will allow our customers to quickly meet government demands for fast pop-up solutions, while also being cost-effective and minimising disruption to pedestrians, cyclists and other road users.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\nFor more information about VIAPATH, visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/viapath-asphalt-for-cycle-lanes-footpaths\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/viapath-asphalt-for-cycle-lanes-footpaths<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<br />\n* &nbsp;For pavements that will be trafficked by heavy vehicles, multiple layers may be required.<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

The 2020 Competition remains open until July 26, 2020.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arqlite gets support from large investors, also working on circular economy issues, such as Kamay Ventures, a venture capital fund made up of Arcor SAIC and Coca-Cola Argentina, and Chriss Graff, founder of the NYC Curb-To-Market Challenge, among others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>MONTERREY, MEXICO. JUNE 30, 2020 \u2013 CEMEX Ventures, CEMEX's Corporate Venture Capital and open innovation unit, today announced its investment in Arqlite SPC, a US company based in California. Arqlite SPC processes unrecyclable plastic waste into artificial gravel that avoids the use of natural quarry aggregates and boulders in the production of light concrete with a low CO2 footprint and installs drainage beds for construction and landscaping. CEMEX Ventures\u2019 new alliance with Arqlite SPC offers an innovative solution around the construction industry\u2019s circular economy: it gives a second life to plastic and reduces the carbon footprint and operating costs of handling and producing construction materials such as aggregates and concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arqlite SPC began its research and development process in Argentina in 2016 and has developed an innovative technology that allows most of the plastic waste to be recycled instead of disposal at a landfill or polluting the environment. The light aggregates it produces represent a great advance in sustainable construction, multiplying thermal and acoustic insulation by 10 times compared to mineral aggregates and offering better construction quality and greater energy conservation. The aggregate is three times lighter than stone, making it excellent for low CO2 concrete that is also intended to reduce required structural supports and to significantly lower transportation costs. The low thermal conductivity of plastic reduces its reaction to extreme temperature variations and, therefore, the possibility of fracturing or altering the concrete mix.<\/p>\n\n<p>One million plastic bottles are purchased every minute and 500 billion plastic bags are used annually. In addition, eight million tons end up in oceans every year, threatening marine life. For this reason, CEMEX Ventures and Arqlite SPC offer a low-cost technological solution, capable of processing the vast majority of plastic waste as raw material. Due mainly to the lack of environmental awareness and existing technological limitations, it is estimated that only 7% of the 300 million tons of plastic waste generated is finally recycled.<\/p>\n\n<p>This investment by CEMEX Ventures is part of CEMEX's ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete to all of its customers globally by 2050, as this solution uses practically all types of plastics as raw material, preventing them from ending up in landfills or unsustainable destinations.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlastic waste processing is a global problem with no large-scale solution so far. We believe that, due to the large volume of material used by the construction industry, we can recycle much of this plastic waste, making us a solution to this problem, while generating construction materials with better functionality and a lower carbon footprint. That is why this investment has a double mission: to help mitigate the great problem of plastic waste and, simultaneously, to produce construction materials with a low CO2 footprint,\" said Cristina Aparicio, Head of CEMEX Ventures investment in Arqlite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arqlite SPC installs version 2.0 of its technology in its new factory in Santa Ana, California, based on developments in Argentina. This new production plant has machinery from different European countries, which, added to the technology designed by the company itself locally, will reach a capacity of 18 thousand tons per year. Its location is strategic for CEMEX, since it is within the radius of several of its concrete and aggregate operations in the California area. In addition, Arqlite already has agreements to recycle plastics from large generators throughout the Los Angeles region and works with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to continue innovating in the construction industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Ventures has joined as investor to Kamay Ventures, venture capital fund of Grupo Arcor SAIC and Coca Cola Argentina, and Chris Graff, founder of NYC Curb-To-Market Challenge, and successful businessman in the manufacturing industry, among others. The good reception to this innovative solution focused on the circular economy has generated interest from numerous actors in different industries, making it easy to scale and implement this solution across various geographies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sebastián Sajoux, CEO and founder of Arqlite SPC, said, \u201cOur technology can become a key player in a large market industry. We have developed a large-scale solution to a large-scale problem.\" Arqlite, which was also the winner of CEMEX Ventures Global Construction Startup Competition 2019, invites entrepreneurs to participate in the 2020 edition of the Competition, which remains open until July 26, 2020. \u201cFor Arqlite SPC, being part of the Global Construction Startup Competition 2019 was very important because working together and being validated by a company like CEMEX Ventures opens new doors for us and helps our brand, which is still small, to reach other large companies that are open to receiving us and hearing about our proposal.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2017, CEMEX Ventures focuses on helping to solve the main challenges and capitalize on the opportunity areas in the construction ecosystem through sustainable solutions. CEMEX Ventures has created an open and collaborative platform to lead the revolution of the construction industry by engaging startups, entrepreneurs, universities, and other relevant actors to tackle the industry's toughest challenges and shape tomorrow's value ecosystem.<br />\nFor more information about CEMEX Ventures, please visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemexventures.com/\">https://www.cemexventures.com/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

These products can be used together for pavements constructed with clay, natural stone or concrete pavers.<br />\nSTREETPAVE PaveBase bedding mortar is made from cement and graded aggregates, and is available in a silo, bulk and 25kg bags. Once applied it is highly durable, suitable for walking on in 12 hours and driving on in 24 hours, and can be laid from 10-75mm in one pass. It is perfect for paved areas of mixed foot and vehicular traffic alongside general private and public hardscape areas.<br />\nMeanwhile, STREETPAVE PaveGrip priming slurry uses specially selected aggregates to create the essential bond between the bedding and the paving element. Delivered in bulk or 25kg bag, it is applied with a brush at 1-2mm thick and is suitable for high-trafficked pavement.<br />\nSTREETPAVE PaveFill flowing joining mortar is the final step in this premium quality system. It is fast-setting and frost resistant with a 40MPa compressive strength and low shrinkage. Simple to mix and apply, PaveFill can be applied in joint widths of 5-50mm and up to 200mm deep in a single pass.<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, commented: \u201cCEMEX is a UK leader in specialist mortar systems for hard landscaping and our new STREETPAVE system is a further demonstration of our expertise; allowing our customers to construct resilient pavements that meet and exceed the strict demands of BS 7533.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe STREETPAVE system has been designed so it can work as a three-stage process with each product tested individually and collectively. The long-term value of using such high-quality products is clear; BS 7533 compliant systems are more robust and provide better overall value than non-compliant systems as they require less maintenance and last longer, in some cases exceeding 40 years. We know our customers want reliable, effective products and we are proud to offer the STREETPAVE system to help meet their paving requirements.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\nFor further information about the STREETPAVE system, please visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/mortar-mix-for-paving-streetpave\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/mortar-mix-for-paving-streetpave<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

Our aim is to ensure that all the children we reach, know that STEM can be for anyone and everyone! This partnership will allow us to promote the variety of STEM based roles we have within our sector to also aid in our continued efforts in diversifying our workplaces. We will be doing this by providing our business expertise and working together with their teams to create lessons that are based around the science within our industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The impact of COVID-19 on the centre has been significant however, they have adapted through digital technologies via online YouTube lessons, virtual school trips and science magazines. Through these new ways of working, they have had over 34,000 children access their online free show and over 450 schools signed up to receive them. The pandemic has had a huge effect on children\u2019s education, in particular with children that are unable to access online teaching. Through the \u2018OpenUpScience\u2019 weekly themed paper magazines packed full of exciting and inspiring STEM activities so children still have the ability to access STEM learning, these magazines have been distributed to foodbanks and COVID 19 response groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Andlyn White, CEMEX UK CSR Specialist, states: \u201cOur goal for this partnership is to assist in reducing the STEM skills gap by engaging with young children and getting them excited about science. We live in a world that is rapidly and continuously changing and it is important that we give all children the opportunity to get involved in STEM based activities regardless of their socioeconomic background, gender or ethnicity. The pandemic has shown us that science continues to be vital in our everyday lives. We are very excited to collaborate with CSC to work towards a common mission to promote that STEM is for everyone\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Cambridge Science Centre have an interactive, hands-on science centre which is a place for young people to engage and learn different areas of science is a very visual and practical way.

        "Body": "<p>By the early 1990s the Dark Green Fritillary was thought to be extinct until a small colony was rediscovered at a former site in the centre of the County. &nbsp;Since then, a huge amount of conservation effort has gone into restoring the fortunes of this butterfly. &nbsp;This effort has paid dividends since Warwickshire now has at least 11 colonies of Dark Green Fritillary and possibly as many as 17. &nbsp;This success would not have been achieved without Butterfly Conservation working in partnership with landowners and other wildlife organisations such as the RSPB. &nbsp;One of the most successful partnerships has been with CEMEX and the RSPB at a number of sites near Southam and in Rugby.<br />\nIn 2013 an area of former quarrying was chosen to try and create bespoke Dark Green Fritillary habitat. &nbsp;It was a spoilbank that had become covered in dense hawthorn scrub which had started to swamp out the delicate wildflowers associated with calcareous or limestone grasslands. &nbsp;The flowers suffering from this scrub encroachment were not only the many orchids such as Greater Butterfly Orchid but also the violets that are the Dark Green Fritillary\u2019s caterpillar food plant.<br />\nA plan was formulated with the support of CEMEX to create a scrub/grassland mosaic. &nbsp;Rather than removing all of the scrub some would be retained in order to provide shelter and the newly created grassy glades would be connected together with wide flowery paths. &nbsp;The remaining scrub would also create shade that would prevent the violets (caterpillar foodplant) from becoming desiccated in the summer sun which could lead to the starvation of the caterpillars. &nbsp;<br />\nSince the initial scrub clearance, the grasslands are generally being maintained in the correct condition for the Dark Green Fritillary by the grazing of the local deer and rabbit populations. &nbsp;However, in years when this grazing is insufficient to maintain the right conditions, then CEMEX come to the rescue by flailing the area to prevent the scrub becoming too dominant again.<br />\nThanks to all this conservation work, the Dark Green Fritillary not only successfully colonised Southam Quarry in 2018 but, because of the near perfect habitat created, the colony has become one of the largest in Warwickshire.<br />\nImage credit: Keith Warmington<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>In addition, the remaining carbon emissions from using the concrete are offset to provide a CarbonNeutral® product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. The product, used for the first time in London, has been supplied to HS2\u2019s enabling works contractor, Costain Skanska joint venture, and Lydon Contracting Ltd by global building materials manufacturer CEMEX, from their plant based in Wembley.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>After engineering carbon reductions into the concrete mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the concrete carbon neutral from manufacture to use.<\/p>\n\n<p>To achieve carbon neutrality, carbon is offset by the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. CEMEX facilitates this by investing in projects which physically remove CO2 where possible from the atmosphere, such as planting more trees or protecting against deforestation through an independently audited and verified project. This is done in accordance with international standards for carbon neutrality.&nbsp;<br />\nThe first use of the Vertua Classic Zero concrete in the capital recently took place at a HS2 site in North West London, ready to prepare the ground for an electricity substation which will power the tunnel boring machines excavating HS2\u2019s London tunnels. A further delivery of Vertua is planned at the same site by the end of October. By using this low carbon concrete, a total of 12 tonnes of carbon should be saved once deliveries are complete, with an additional 17 tonnes of residual CO2 offset. &nbsp;<br />\nDiscussions are continuing as to how this technology can be adopted on further sites across the HS2 route.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>HS2 aims to build the most sustainable highspeed railway in the world and is driving innovation in design, construction and operation to minimise its entire carbon footprint. In order to become the UK\u2019s most environmentally responsible infrastructure project, HS2 has set a carbon reduction target of 50% target for its contractors on construction baselines for Phase One civil assets (such as tunnels, viaducts and cuttings), stations and railway systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Peter Miller, Environment Director, HS2 Ltd said:<br />\n\u201cWe know that climate change is the greatest long-term threat to Britain\u2019s security and prosperity. The Government has set a target for net-zero emissions by 2050 and HS2 is playing its part in meeting that challenge.<br />\n\u201cUsing innovative techniques and products in the construction of the new high speed railway, we can not only build HS2 more sustainably, but we can lead by example, showing how the construction sector can help deliver Britain\u2019s cleaner greener future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Dan Hunt, Programme Director at Costain Skanska joint venture said:<br />\n\u201cWorking closely with our supply chain, CSjv has identified many ways to maximise our environmental credentials, leading to more than 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) saved to date. We have focused on identifying innovations and efficiencies throughout our whole programme, from our power supplies and fuel sources through to working methodology by reducing and recycling materials.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe have worked hard to reduce the amount of concrete needed across the programme and by working with CEMEX, we have further reduced our carbon footprint of our works.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Richard Kershaw, Technical Manager for Materials at CEMEX UK, said:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are proud to have supplied this HS2 site with our Vertua concrete, the first time this low-carbon product has been used in our country\u2019s capital. We know that minimising the carbon footprint for the HS2 project is of real importance, and our Vertua concrete offers an easy way to make a more sustainable choice for such an important product. We look forward to exploring the other opportunities for Vertua to be used as part of HS2 .\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>When operational HS2 will offer people a cleaner, greener way to travel with lower carbon emissions per passenger kilometre, than cars and domestic air travel. HS2 trains will be highly energy efficient and powered by electricity from an increasingly decarbonised electricity grid. In the future, with electricity generation fully decarbonised, travelling on HS2 will be a zero-carbon activity. In addition HS2 will free up extra space on the existing rail network. It will take cars and lorries off the road and reduce the need for domestic air travel. This will reduce transport carbon emissions and improve air quality.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nENDS<br />\nNotes to Editors&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (\u201cCEMEX\u201d) (NYSE: CX) announced today that the Carbon Trust has validated its roadmap to decarbonize global operations in line with the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) 2-degree scenario (2DS) developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The validated roadmap would enable the company to achieve a 35% reduction of net carbon emissions by 2030.<br />\nThe validation scope included CEMEX's worldwide cement operations, with a detailed analysis of plants expected to contribute at least 80% of the direct and indirect organizational CO2 emission reductions needed to achieve the 2030 target. The Carbon Trust assessed the technical feasibility of key technology and decarbonization levers based on guidelines defined by international institutions such as the International Energy Agency, the Cement Sustainability Initiative, and the European Climate Research Alliance. The CO2 reduction levers included alternative fuels, decarbonated raw materials, renewable power projects, and novel cements, among others. The validation also included a thorough review of CEMEX's commitment to implement these levers based on governance mechanisms and business planning.<br />\nThe analysis concluded that all the technologies considered are sufficiently mature and market ready. The right business planning is in place to achieve the results within the required time frame. The estimated CO2 emissions reductions from planned initiatives were found to be realistic, considering plant-specific characteristics and local market conditions.<br />\n\"The Carbon Trust validation confirms that CEMEX has a robust climate change strategy, the appropriate corporate governance and planning mechanisms for the implementation of a pathway to reduce our CO2 emissions in line with the 2-degree scenario,\u201d said Vicente Saiso, CEMEX's Director of Sustainability. \"With this important validation as well as the availability of viable technology, we are even more resolved to implement our roadmap and proceed with the necessary investments. The assessment conducted by the Carbon Trust supports the work we have done to date, and we look forward to collaborating with them more in the future as we pursue even more ambitious goals.\u201d<br />\nAleyn Smith-Gillespie, Associate Director Advisory at the Carbon Trust said, \u201cThe magnitude and complexity of change required by a company such as CEMEX to decarbonize its global operations is significant. Our assessment provides the organization\u2019s management, investors and stakeholders with an independent validation that its commitments are backed up by sound assumptions and planning. Our engagement with CEMEX\u2019s internal community of decision-makers and experts, and our review of the pipeline of decarbonisation opportunities provides a foundation for the company to continue raising its climate ambition.\u201d<br />\nThe validation of CEMEX's emission reduction strategy was carried out based on limited assurance, following principles defined by the ISO 14064 part 3 of the Standard. The findings validate CEMEX's roadmap for reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The assessment also concluded that technological solutions and market conditions supported the company's decarbonization pathway and that the appropriate corporate governance and business planning structures were in place to implement the strategy.<\/p>\n\n<p>ENDS<br />\nNotes to Editors&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

It is now a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. Such is the popularity of the nature reserve, an area of restored former sand and gravel quarries alongside the River Trent south of Nottingham, that the charity reached its ambitious £1million target in a matter of weeks \u2013 enabling negotiations over the sale of the site to begin.<br />\nNow, with contracts signed and exchanged, Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust is planning for the long-term future of the site, which provides a safe haven for over 1,000 species including otters and bitterns and welcomes an estimated half a million visitors each year.<br />\nSince being opened by Sir David Attenborough in 1966 Attenborough Nature Reserve, situated on the edge of Nottingham, has become one of the best loved nature reserves in the UK. The Trust has worked closely with CEMEX over this period to create a reserve which is an excellent example of how industry can work with conservation bodies to create a site high in biodiversity which is of national importance.<br />\nStephen Redwood, Land Development and Permitting Director for CEMEX Europe said \u201cAfter more than half a century of partnership, we are enormously pleased to see the transfer of this amazing and award-winning site to the Trust being completed. To see Attenborough evolve into such an important nature reserve in such close proximity to major population centres has been most rewarding.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cOur partnership with the Trust - which has included the establishment of the impressive Visitor Centre with support from the company\u2019s own Landfill Communities Fund - has been a major success and we look forward to the Trust taking ownership as the site moves on to the next phase in its development.\u201d<br />\nSpeaking on behalf of the Trust, Chief Executive Paul Wilkinson said: \u201cThe support of Biffa Award and the backing of the public and our supporters has delivered a prize that we have been working with CEMEX to achieve for some time. Attenborough is a cherished site, where so many come to connect with nature. Our aspiration has always been to take the site into our ownership so that we can plan for its long-term future and that future begins today. We would like to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone that has made it possible including Biffa Award, our supporters and CEMEX.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong><br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX Ventures, CEMEX's Corporate Venture Capital and open innovation unit, announced today its investment in Modulous, a company with a disruptive offsite construction system, enabled by a digital platform, to allow the high-speed delivery of quality, sustainable and affordable homes. This will transform the construction process as it is currently known, providing the industry with a unique modular construction solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>It has become apparent that modular construction, in its current form, is not efficient. Although it does improve speed and quality of the build process, it needs to make significant improvements to solve the housing crisis. London-based startup Modulous offers a new approach to increase the home production for the UK and support ambitions to meet the housing requirements for the year 2050, when 3 billion people are expected to live in cities, representing 70% of the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Modulous aims to achieve this through a new construction approach based on a highly engineered kit-of-parts that enables the delivery of high-quality affordable homes at scale and pace. The software platform leverages artificial intelligence, generative design and 5D BIM modelling providing a fully integrated supply chain solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>By digitizing the entire materials supply chain management, Modulous reduces the time and cost overruns common in the construction process. By decentralizing operations this solution can scale rapidly as assembly of the modules is carried out by companies local to the final site. The construction system is easy to assemble, converting the kit of parts into homes in hours instead of months, and further reducing the industry shortage of professionalization.<\/p>\n\n<p>Through their innovative approach, Modulous has already secured a large pipeline of projects across the UK and Europe. It is currently preparing the delivery of a £6.5m residential scheme in London using its smart design and construction system that will achieve completion 12 months ahead of schedule.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"By including Modulous in our portfolio, we offer the industry a unique offsite construction model\" said Mateo Zimermmann, head of CEMEX Ventures investment in Modulous. \"After several years of exploring how this segment is advancing, we placed our trust in this team that perfectly combines engineers, designers, and technological developers. The Modulous innovative approach enables the supply chain to deliver sustainable and high-quality homes, significantly reducing time and costs. Modulous does not require additional capex, which makes it globally scalable. This team is going to revolutionise the residential development industry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Although we are currently focused on the south of England, where we expect to achieve sales of £25 million in the pilot year, we want to offer a global solution to housing needs in Europe,\" said Chris Bone, Co-Founder and Managing Director by Modulous. \"We are delighted to be part of CEMEX's global vision for offsite construction and future collaborations to launch advanced and tailored materials through collaboration in research and development. Having the support and access to customers and suppliers of CEMEX and CEMEX Ventures makes us a more relevant player in the industry where we participate\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Modulous is one of the winners of the 2020 Construction Startup Competition, the annual startup challenge organized by CEMEX Ventures. This startup was also part of the Top 50 ConTech Startups list in 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>About Modulous<br />\nModulous is an award winning, London-based construction technology business that has developed a digital platform and smart kit of parts to enable the delivery of high-quality, sustainable and affordable homes, at scale and pace. The dynamic team of engineers, designers, and software developers has conceived a unique approach that aims to transform the delivery of homes and support ambitions to address the global housing crisis. With its values firmly rooted in creating sustainable places for people to live, at the speed that is needed, Modulous aims to cause a seismic shift within the global construction process.

        "Body": "<p>The Tunnel is being built to upgrade London\u2019s sewer system to cope with its growing population. Currently, London relies on a 150-year-old sewer system built for a population less than half its current size. As a result, during periods of heavy rain, the current infrastructure can become overwhelmed.<br />\nThe new 25km tunnel will intercept, store and transfer sewage waste away from the River Thames.&nbsp;<br />\nStarting in Acton, west London, the Thames Tideway Tunnel will travel through the heart of London at depths of between 30 and 60 metres, using gravity to transfer waste eastwards and be processed and dealt with in a modern state of the art facility.<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s primary lining spray concrete is being used for the shafts and launch tunnels in the central part of the project \u2013 a 12.5km stretch of the tunnel moving under central London which is being constructed by a joint venture between Ferrovial Construction and Laing O\u2019Rourke (FLO). The concrete is sprayed from bottom to top in one continuous operation until the shaft wall is complete. An extremely complicated mix is required, consisting of eight separate constituents which when combined give a high strength of +60N/mm2, consistence&nbsp;of 600mm flow and a consistence flow&nbsp;of two hours.&nbsp;<br />\nWhen sprayed it has to adhere to the tunnel or shaft wall / ceiling and gain strength immediately to a high rate of strength gain requirements. The concrete also needs to be highly pumpable, in some cases with a pipeline length of up to 400m.<br />\nCEMEX manufactures the product at its dedicated Spray Concrete plant in Buxton, from where it is transported into central London at rates that peak at around 3,000 tonnes per month. Supply is likely to continue for a few months, although this may need to be extended due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;<br />\nSergio Menendez, President of CEMEX Europe, Middle East, Africa &amp; Asia, said: \u201cThe Tideway project is one of incredible scale which will solve serious capacity issues with London\u2019s sewer system and have considerable benefits for the area\u2019s wildlife and population, while also creating jobs, a rejuvenated river economy and new areas of public space.<br />\n\u201cThis is a serious piece of engineering, and we\u2019re proud to be working with world-class contractors to build this key infrastructure in the most sustainable and cost-effective way possible for one of the world\u2019s greatest cities.&nbsp;<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, added: \u201cOur sprayed concrete forms a key part of the central part of the tunnel and it was vital to get the complicated mix right. Fortunately, we have worked with FLO before and so there was already an understanding of the works required and the performance required from the material to be supplied.\u201d<br />\nBorja Trashorras, Project Manager at FLO\u2019s Albert Embankment site, said: \u201cCEMEX\u2019s primary lining spray concrete provided a good solution at Albert Embankment Foreshore for the construction of both connection tunnels and our 53m drop shaft through some challenging ground conditions. Having sprayed over 5,000 tonnes for this package of works meant we built a strong and reliable line of communication with CEMEX. Logistical planning was essential in the delivery of these works due to our central London location which CEMEX was able to co-ordinate and support with ease.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

        "Body": "<p>The LEILAC 2 project is funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. The project team comprises leading industrial, technology, and research &amp; development partners.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX had a very active participation in LEILAC 1, working with the partners to develop the novel direct separation of process carbon emissions derived from the clinker/cement manufacture. The highly concentrated CO2 resulting from the technology can then be easily handled via capture and/or storage. Process emissions are roughly 60% of the direct CO2 emissions from cement production. Thus, this technology can contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the whole sector.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is enthusiastic and determined to continue its contributions to the project by bringing expertise, experience, and key resources. For example, simulation experts undertook significant modeling of the CO2 reactor tube to obtain the required capture rate. CEMEX's technical team also tested novel designs for the CO2 reactor tube, given its deep understanding of the cement production process and how the technology can be implemented most effectively.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX decided to participate in LEILAC 2 pursuing and contributing to the technology's development utilizing its gasification process's expertise. It is also leveraging its skills in alternative fuel consumption and computational fluid dynamic simulation design, aiming to succeed in the second stage of the LEILAC project.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Our participation in the LEILAC 2 project is another example of our continued efforts to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete products globally by 2050,\" said Davide Zampini, Head of Global R&amp;D. \"We are determined to have a significant direct involvement in research and development efforts pursuing high impact technologies in carbon capture, use, and storage.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced in 2020 its Climate Action strategy, defining a global target of a 35% reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products by 2030. For its operations in Europe, CEMEX also defined a 55% reduction target, in line with what the European Commission set as a new goal for all its member states. To complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX also established an ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete to all its customers globally by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

The product is self-compacting and can be installed on large scale projects.<br />\nSteve Crompton, Director of Quality and Product Technology for CEMEX Materials West Europe, commented: \u201cOur technical expertise has enabled us to develop a new, more Sustainable, premium quality screed that will help increase the efficiency of the job site, allow effective use of labour and improve the climate impact of projects.

It was named after the traditional cobbled streets of the iconic Camden market in London, with the name chosen by members of CEMEX\u2019s team.&nbsp;<br />\nThis product is ideal for the domestic market, particularly for use on driveways and housing estates.&nbsp;<br />\nFor more information about ReadyPave® Camden visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/readypave-camden-concrete-block-paving\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/readypave-camden-concrete-block-paving<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>The report highlights the company\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the essential value of its industrial activity, its Climate Action strategy, and its commitment to drive the industry\u2019s innovation by unlocking new value opportunities.<br />\n\u201c2020 was undoubtedly a very challenging year, with COVID-19 abruptly upending every aspect of our lives and disrupting every industry worldwide. At CEMEX, that uncertainty and the challenges it posed brought out the best in our people. It also revealed the essential nature of our products and services, the value we bring to our customers, and the strength and resiliency of our business,\u201d said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. \u201cSustainability remains to be one of our top priorities, and our Climate Action strategy makes us confident in our ability to achieve our targets and aspirations.\u201d<br />\nAmong the main accomplishments presented in CEMEX Integrated Report 2020 are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>CEMEX developed and implemented more than 50 strict hygiene and safety protocols to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 contagion throughout its worldwide sites and operations.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX reached a low level of employee lost-time injuries (LTIs) for the sector and made progress across most of its countries, with 96% of its operations achieving zero fatalities and LTIs.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX Go was instrumental in allowing customers and employees to work remotely with seamless efficiency and consistently, safely, and reliably deliver products despite the challenging circumstances. 61% of CEMEX total global sales were made digitally through CEMEX Go, with a 90% overall usage rate among recurring customers and high customer satisfaction levels.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy in February 2020, defining a global target of a 35% reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products by 2030. To complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX also established an ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete to all its customers globally by 2050.<\/li>\n\t<li>For its European operations, CEMEX reduced its net CO2 emissions by close to 35% as of December 31st, 2020, and is the first company in the cement industry to define a 55% reduction target, in line with what the European Commission set as a new goal for all its member states.<\/li>\n\t<li>91% of the company´s cement plants co-processed a cumulative 2.7 million tons of waste as alternative fuels, allowing for approximately 1.6 million tons of coal replaced and a 25.3% substitution rate.<\/li>\n\t<li>Clean electricity now covers 29% of CEMEX global consumption in its cement business. In some countries such as the U.K. and Poland, renewable power covers 100% of local cement, concrete, and aggregates business needs.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX globally introduced Vertua®, its low carbon and net-zero CO2 products, a key milestone towards the company´s 2050 CO2 neutrality goal. Vertua® Ultra Zero is the industry\u2019s first concrete product with a Net Zero CO2 footprint, and is already being used in relevant infrastructure and building projects around the world.<\/li>\n\t<li>To respond to market changes in outlook resulting from the pandemic, CEMEX launched Operation Resilience, a medium-term plan to improve operating results, margins and promote growth, sustainability, and financial resilience.<\/li>\n\t<li>The company increased its financial flexibility with the successful amendment of its bank debt under its Facilities Agreement. This transaction underscores CEMEX´s commitment to a carbon-neutral economy by incorporating green metrics and is one of the largest sustainability-linked loans in the world and the largest in emerging markets.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX strengthened the Social Impact strategy that allows it to reinforce initiatives to contribute to communities' well-being. The company positively impacted more than 23 million people on an accumulated basis, contributing to the U.N.

        "Body": "<p>Together with Bowker, its logistics partner at Selby, and Potter Space (owners of the business park where Selby is located), more than £200,000 has been invested into new rail freight infrastructure and facilities, ensuring the ongoing reliability of the service from this site and enabling the team to increase the number of trains that can run a week.<br />\nConsiderable improvements have been made to the track that travels off the main line and into the Selby depot. Following the investment, around 70 per cent of the track has been completely replaced, with other upgrades such as concrete sleepers made to improve the condition of the track further, and the installation of new loading bays.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, Bowker have made significant investment in its stone discharge facilities at Selby; upgrading safety features to go beyond legislative requirements as well as making significant improvements to equipment and enhancing critical components increasing reliability.&nbsp;<br />\nNeil Bowker, Bowker\u2019s Commercial Director, said: \u201cThe features, including new guards and fencing, are focussed on operator safety; and in general, the improvements will deliver reductions in down time during critical discharge periods. The significant investment demonstrates the commitment Bowker have made to the CEMEX partnership.\u201d<br />\nAs a result of the developments made at the Selby site, the team have been able to increase the number of services run from this depot to three a week. This means an extra 90,000 tonnes of material can be moved by train, taking trucks off the road and maximising the use of rail as a sustainable mode of transport. All this helps support CEMEX\u2019s climate objectives and minimises its impact on the environment.<br />\nDave Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK and France, commented: \u201cWe continue to invest heavily into our rail operations across the country, as this allows us to grow volumes and increase the services we offer. The works at Selby were the latest part of our development programme and it was fantastic to partner with Bowker and Potter Space on the many improvements that have been made \u2013 improvements that will enable us to better and more safely support our customers.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cEnhancing the sustainability of our business is a key priority and the use of rail forms an important part of this \u2013 as every rail freight service removes trucks from the road and achieves additional carbon savings. These investments help us to support CEMEX\u2019s climate initiatives and be a more responsible company.\u201d<br />\nJason Rockett, managing director of Potter Space, added, \u201cPotter Space has a proven track record of working together with customers, so we were pleased to work in partnership with both CEMEX and Bowker at our Potter Space Selby business park. All three parties recognise the value and benefit of rail transportation, so we were delighted to jointly invest in the new rail infrastructure to help meet the needs of CEMEX and support its long-term business plans.\u201d<br />\nThese improvements come as part of a wider investment into Selby, with £0.5million planned for three new bitumen tanks and a reprocessed asphalt system. These will help to achieve further operating efficiencies and minimise waste while improving safety and customer service.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About Bowker Group<br />\nThe Company is a major UK and International logistics provider operating in excess of 160 vehicles and 300 trailers as well as providing over one million square feet of warehousing at their 7 UK Distribution Centres.

        "Summary": "Global building materials solutions supplier CEMEX is proud to present VIALOW, a new addition to the VERTUA family of low carbon and sustainable building solutions. VIALOW is a reduced carbon asphalt which comes with the option to offset residual CO2 to make it a CarbonNeutral® product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.",

        "Display Title": "CEMEX Launches \"VIALOW\" Asphalt - A CarbonNeutral®️ Product",
        "Body": "<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy in February 2020, and in its European operations reduced its CO2 emissions by close to 35% as of December 31st, 2020, ten years ahead of the target date. CEMEX also declared a 55% CO2 reduction target for its European Operations, aligning with the European Commission goal for all member states.<br />\nVIALOW is a new range of low temperature, low carbon asphalts from CEMEX, which uses a specially formulated bitumen additive to enable manufacture at up to 40°C lower than standard asphalt mixes with no compromise in performance, with the added benefit of achieving up to 20% reduction in embodied carbon emissions.&nbsp;<br />\nThe range includes the VIALOW Zero option, which is a CarbonNeutral product, and complements the CEMEX VERTUA range of low carbon building solutions, further enhancing CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action strategy \u2013 committed to Net Zero CO2. As technology and the industry shifts toward low carbon asphalt, the best interim way to sequester the rest of the CO2 footprint, to make it a carbon neutral product, is through carbon offsetting. To do this we are working with Natural Capital Partners, an award-winning expert on carbon neutrality and climate finance, that is harnessing the power of business to create a more sustainable world.<\/p>\n\n<p>VIALOW offers customers a host of other benefits alongside its sustainability credentials. The lower temperature of the manufacturing process can also help to improve the long-term performance and durability of the asphalt, as high temperature in conventional mixes leads to more oxidative hardening of bitumen than is seen in lower temperature variants.<br />\nReduced temperature asphalt also offers safety and environmental benefits which include a reduced risk of burns and lower odours, providing a safer and more pleasant working environment for both workers and neighbours to the construction site. The reduced mixing and paving temperatures of low temperature asphalt can reduce fume generation by around 50% for approximately each 10°C reduction in temperature.<br />\nFurthermore, by virtue of being a low temperature asphalt, VIALOW allows the re-opening of a jobsite more quickly after completion of road works, as the asphalt reaches appropriate trafficking temperatures faster than conventional hot mix asphalt. Alongside minimising disruption and enabling construction programmes to remain on time, this offers further benefits to the environment, as statistics show that stationary traffic caused by road closures creates four times as many pollutants when compared to moving vehicles.<br />\nThe launch of this range follows a report from the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Highways which identified warm mix asphalts (WMA) as an underutilised opportunity to reduce the CO2 emissions associated with asphalt production for road infrastructure. At the time of publishing, the report found that WMAs represent less than 4% of UK asphalt production, yet if all asphalt production in Great Britain had been switched to WMA, it would have saved at least 61,000 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 the equivalent of cutting almost 300 million miles of car journeys.<br />\nCarl Platt, Director of Asphalt, Paving, and Building Products for Europe, commented: \u201cAsphalt is an essential part of our country\u2019s infrastructure; roads provide access to employment, social, health and education services, provide access to more areas and stimulate economic and social development. However, we recognise that future construction needs to be balanced with the effect it is having on the environment.\u201d<br />\n\u201cCEMEX is totally committed to improving the sustainability of its operations and supporting its customers to do the same. With the launch of VIALOW, CEMEX aims to make it simple for customers to choose more sustainable and environmentally-friendly asphalts that have a lower embodied carbon, offset residual emissions and help drive vital change.<br />\n\u201cMoreover, this industry-leading range of low temperature asphalt is designed to produce faster construction times, minimise disruption and reduce road maintenance costs alongside the added benefit of a carbon footprint reduction.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX Urbanisation Solutions is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on our Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.&nbsp;<br />\nVIALOW is available all year round in all Asphalt Concrete Base, Binder and Surface courses as well as Hot Rolled Asphalt (only where pre coated chippings are not required), Stone Mastic Asphalt and the full Proprietary range.<br />\nAfter engineering carbon reductions into the asphalt mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction, transportation and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the asphalt CarbonNeutral from cradle-to-customer.<br />\nCarbon offsetting is the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX will facilitate this by financing projects which physically remove CO2 from the atmosphere, such as planting trees. A CarbonNeutral certificate is then issued to the client.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX calculates the embodied carbon (as CO2e) in the VIALOW range using a Carbon Footprint Calculator in accordance with relevant standards and guidance.&nbsp;<br />\nFor more information about VIALOW visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/vialow-low-temperature-asphalt-for-faster-construction\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/vialow-low-temperature-asphalt-for-faster-construction<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>We want to shine a spotlight on some of the great biodiversity work that is being carried out at CEMEX sites across the country.<br />\nFirst up, we\u2019re going to take a look at Denge quarry in Lydd, Kent. This site has a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) in place, and despite the impact of the Coronavirus the team have made good progress on this over the last year.<br />\nThe Denge team have a great relationship with the adjacent RSPB nature reserve at Dungeness. Together they have removed scrub from the islands in the quarry\u2019s saline lagoon (five Islands and several peninsulas in this lagoon have been created as part of the restoration). Scrub, if left, would turn into woodland and make islands unsuitable for ground nesting birds. The removal activity maintains the wildlife value and protects the important habitat it provides for numerous species of birds and insects.<\/p>\n\n<p>Being coastal, Denge is key for breeding wetland birds, particularly sea birds. Decoy nesting gulls have also been installed to encourage Black Headed Gulls and Common Tern to nest in safe nonoperational areas, on the shingle islands. The team have monitored the site for bryophyte plants (such as moss, liverworts and hornworts) with a view to managing the negative impacts of invasive non-native species. One such species is Crassula Helmsii (New Zealand \u2013 Stonecrop), which can form dense, tangled growth of stems underwater, on the shoreline. These choke out native wildlife, such as the endangered Sussex Emerald moth currently found in one area of Dungeness, where it lives in vegetated shingle.<br />\nOver the last year, the team at Denge have spotted 158 species of wildlife, including birds such as Gadwall, Tufted Duck, Little Grebe, Black Headed Gull and Common Tern and three types of reptile: Adder, Grass Snake and Common Lizard.<br />\nFor 2021 and beyond, a comprehensive list of actions have been decided, and these include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Creating fish reefs using large willow<\/li>\n\t<li>Creating areas of wild carrot, fenced, to prevent rabbits<\/li>\n\t<li>Profiling margins for reedbed growth<\/li>\n\t<li>Checking of gabion baskets and island stability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>With these actions, the site\u2019s wider BMP (BAP) will help ensure that Denge provides a diverse and developing environment for wildlife.<br />\nWell done to all those at the site and in the UK Sustainability team who are working hard to enhance Denge\u2019s eco credentials!&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The scientific name of the Sand Martin, Riparia, means \u201criverbank.\u201d With their traditional home being sandy sided riverbanks; so their food consists of small insects, mostly gnats and other flies that are associated with waterways and lakes. However, any steep sided sand bank is potential a nesting site. If you manage a site with sand or even dust piles that attract sand martins, there are two key measures to follow; firstly maintain an area suitable for their nesting with a sheer sand face, away from operational activities, and secondly keep operational sand piles sloped at 45 degrees or less to ensure the sand martins don\u2019t choose working piles as their new nest site.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although sand martins are maintaining a healthy population that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t face several challenges. One of the amazing facts about sand martins is their migration, they winter in east and southern Africa by crossing the Sahara Desert nonstop (as there\u2019s nowhere to feed!). The Sahara is the largest desert in the world, measuring approximately 3,000 miles from east to west and 1,200 miles from north to south. Before crossing the Sahara Desert, the Sand Martins store up just enough fat to keep them going through the journey without needing to refuel. Without enough fat, they won\u2019t have the energy to make the crossing, but if they store too much fat they\u2019ll be weighed down and their flight won\u2019t be efficient. &nbsp;All of this is from a bird that is just 12-14cm long, weighs 13.5g and lives on gnats! Knowing this might bring a little more sympathy and admiration for them when you see the Sand Martins return this spring from their 10,000 mile journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>This species originally nested in the steep, sandy banks of rivers, but have adapted to using many different man-made sites with Sand Martins banks often added to CEMEX sites\u2019 restoration schemes.<\/p>\n\n<p>An example of this can be found at Berkswell Quarry in Quarry. Andy Barber, Quarry Manager at Berkswell Quarry, explains: \u201cWe built a Sand Martin \u2018hotel\u2019 at Berkswell a few years ago, to provide somewhere for the birds to nest while protecting our excavation. It now only requires minimal maintenance each year \u2013 the birds tend to arrive on site from April onwards, so before this we scrape the face of the \u2018hotel\u2019 to make sure it is clean and vertical. As soon as the birds start arriving, we leave it alone. There are around 60 holes on the \u2018hotel\u2019 for the Sand Martins to nest in and generally we see about 50-60 pairs using it each year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re lovely little birds and it\u2019s interesting to watch them return each year \u2013 they often seem to return to the same hole. It\u2019s phenomenal how they create their nests really and its great that they can have a safe haven with us. We should be doing what we can to help the wildlife that uses our sites \u2013 it\u2019s important to get the balance between maintaining habitats and continuing our operations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The birds seem to be returning a little slower this year, perhaps because it is quite cold for April. We always look forward to welcoming them back to our site!\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

This includes a large section of land close to the eastern site boundary and also a section near the weighbridge, just north west of the lake. Both areas will regenerate naturally \u2013 the smaller area near the weighbridge has had brash from heather cutting spread on it to encourage lowland dry heath growth. Some work along the southern boundary was also carried out, to cut heather and remove gorse bushes to prevent succession to scrub.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both of these areas are expected to become lowland dry heath and or lowland acid grassland habitats. In total, the area of land restored comes to 2.2 hectares. Additionally, contractors treated invasive weeds on site, which was successful; only minimal amounts of ragwort are now present.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over the last year, the team at West Heath have spotted 177 species, with animals including roe deer and badgers, birds such as sand martins, skylark and linnet, as well as rarer nightjar and woodcock birds. Egyptian geese (pictured), mute swan, greylag and canada geese are also frequent visitors.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the year ahead, priorities include monitoring for reptiles alongside ecologists; last year adders, grass snakes, slow worms and common lizards were spotted and future sights could impact restoration plans. There is a reptile refuge in the middle of the site and restoration will see more of this created.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Last year, there were some issues with sand martins nesting in stockpiles and so plans are in place to create new nesting faces for the birds during 2021.<\/p>\n\n<p>Closer attention will also be paid to the 0.5 hectares of mire which are along the southern and western shores of the lake and periodically under water. This area is used by birds for feeding.<br />\nTogether with the RSPB, the team at West Heath are working hard to provide a wide range of different habitats for wildlife.

The plant is expected to generate about 2 MW of electrical power, which is around 8% of the cement plant requirements.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX places Climate Action as a daily priority and supports EU policies towards net zero CO2 targets. As a global group, CEMEX aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 35% by 2030 compared to 1990 and to deliver net zero CO2 concrete by 2050. In 2020 CEMEX\u2019s European operations had reduced CO2 emissions by around 35%, and became the first Company in the sector to align to the EU\u2019s aspiration to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe new sCO2 technology has a smaller footprint and higher operational flexibility than conventional power plant cycles, which produce power from turbines using water or steam. The sCO2 cycles use CO2 that is in a supercritical state - at a temperature and pressure above its critical point where liquid and gas phases are not distinguishable\u201d \u2013 said Karol Czubara, CEMEX\u2019s Prachovice Cement Plant Director.<br />\nThe project further demonstrates CEMEX\u2019s clear Climate Action strategy which shows further progression on upscaling ground breaking technologies to decarbonise the business and meet EU and CEMEX climate targets.<br />\nMore information on the project and the consortium partners can be found at:&nbsp;<a

        "Body": "<p>The RSPB worked with CEMEX to restore the site using best practice conservation techniques, CEMEX and RSPB staff took part in the event, scattering heather brash from a local SSSI heathland at Sutton Park, by hand in inaccessible areas and machine in flatter locations.&nbsp;<br />\nThe heather brash is cuttings of heather that contain tiny seeds- propagules (dust like). The benefit of using brash is that other heath species will also be collected and spread, along with any associated microbes. There are lots of little-understood interactions between plants and microbes, and this method gives the new potential seedlings the best shot at establishing well. &nbsp;Once the brash is scattered you just wait and see.&nbsp;<br />\nHeather potentially germinates twice a year, but the soil pH, weather and moisture conditions need to be right. In the spring following brash scattering we had a late severe snowy cold snap named \u2018beast from the east\u2019 1 and 2 - bringing snow into May. Plus, we\u2019ve had exceptionally dry springs with little or no rain, followed by poor summers and wet winters! Luckily heather seeds last a very long time, (Heather seeds have a half-life of circa 50-60 years i.e. half the seeds are viable for 50-60yrs) some, found at archaeological sites have been known to germinate after a thousand years.&nbsp;<br />\nLast year in 2020 we had started to get very concerned that perhaps there was something wrong at site \u2013 some other reason for the lack of germination, and found that on part of the land some on the deeper subsoils under that\u2019s sandy topsoil we\u2019re not the ideal pH. &nbsp;However, site was always intended to be a heathland mosaic of features and not wall to wall heather so we weren\u2019t too concerned.&nbsp;<br />\nThen last month a site visit brought us all a feeling of Joy\u2026. HEATHER at last, upwards of 100 first year heather seedlings. We were relieved and over the moon \u2013 such positive signs of things to come.&nbsp;<br />\nJust shows if we do the right thing, be patient and nature will come up trumps when we give it chance.<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

The system is currently live at 39 sites, and is being used 2,000 times a week, with that figure steadily increasing week on week.<br />\nCEMEX has made this commitment to nationwide rollout of mp connect because it will help to streamline its own processes and enhance management of hauliers and contractors. It will ensure all drivers meet legislative and site requirements and enable the business to continually raise standards and lead the industry in safety and compliance.<br />\nDave Hart, Supply Chain Director for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cSafety is CEMEX\u2019s number one priority and we are always looking for ways to make our processes in this area more streamlined and effective.

For this spectacular achievement, CEMEX delivered more than 40,000 m3 of concrete, including low carbon formulations, and removed 42,000 tonnes or spoil materials via its multimodal transport network.<br />\nThese multi-use skyscrapers presented huge technical challenges to the construction team as they are inclined at an angle of 5° (more than the leaning tower of Pisa) and were built on a very narrow site. The foundations, diaphragm walls and nine basement levels required specialist concrete to enable long six-hour pours and high-quality facings.<br />\nOf the 40,000 m3 of ready-mixed concrete supplied from local CEMEX units, 25% was for concrete foundations for diaphragm walls, and 75% for civil engineering and architectural concrete for elevations. The client also required high-performance concrete for pouring a mega-beam supporting all the towers and with an integrated cooling system. The latter was &nbsp; designed and delivered by the Paris Port-Victor production unit. All the concrete was designed with formulations to reduce the building's carbon footprint, in particular for the foundations.&nbsp;<br />\nIn 2021, 150 m3 of black decorative concrete was pumped for the construction of the terraces of the two towers, while fast-drying anhydrite screed was installed on nearly 2,000 m² of heated floors. In addition, during these three years, thanks to its robust multimodal logistics system, CEMEX will have evacuated almost all of the spoil - nearly 42,000 tonnes.<br />\nThe strong commitment of CEMEX's technical teams ensured the success of the operation. For a complex project like this, excellent communication between the various CEMEX departments (commercial, technical, production) and the concrete manufacturing teams enabled smooth and consistent concrete deliveries during long days and weekends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Any pallets damaged beyond repair are recycled. Nationwide collections are available within 10 working days on average from request, with capacity for up to 250 pallets (550 pallets for an articulated vehicle) per load, but can be as few as 50 pallets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Graeme Barton, National Sales Manager Packed Cement, CEMEX, commented: \u201cWe want to make life easier for our merchants to work with us to reduce waste. We\u2019d like to make pallet recovery part of the standard delivery process, as many pallets still end up in landfill. It is increasingly costly to dispose of pallet waste and there is far greater value to be gained by recycling and reuse. Rising timber costs, combined with pallet shortages, means there is a heightened need to conserve and maintain pallets throughout the supply chain. Recovery is considerably more cost effective than buying new replacements.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cPallets are a standard format in transporting building products and contribute a significant financial and environmental cost which needs to be captured by the user. We saw a similar situation with supermarkets and plastic bags, but we\u2019d rather not wait for legislation to enforce this, we\u2019d really like to make a difference now with preventative action. The pallet recovery service is regenerative by design and aims to support the key principals of the circular economy to benefit business, society and the environment. If we all pull together it will have a significant impact across the whole supply chain.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

The pre-fabricated track embedded in concrete (supplied by CEMEX\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions business) was chosen for this development to ensure a quick turnaround of work, keeping outages down and minimising the impact on the customer.&nbsp;<br />\nMark Grimshaw Smith, Rail and Sea Manager for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cThe summer months have provided us with the perfect opportunity to complete a considerable programme of investment into track at three of our rail depots. These sites are all very different, and spread out across the country, but they are all important parts of our rail network and ripe for development.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cAs our use of trains to transport our materials increases, it is vital that we have the infrastructure in place to support this. Further investment is planned at some of our other UK railheads over the coming months.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s use of trains to move its building materials is growing year on year, with considerable efforts being made by the business to switch from road freight to rail and sea.

More than 220M buildings in Europe representing approximately 85% of the building stock built before 2021 will mostly still be standing in 2050, yet currently only 1% of buildings undergo energy-efficient renovation every year. The energy performance of buildings is a major area for improvement in public policies, for new build and the renovation of the existing stock. From residential housing, to public buildings and urban schemes, across the board we\u2019re demonstrating to our customers that by improving the built environment, we can significantly improve our natural environment too.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cConcrete has a critical role to play in the transition to a Low-Carbon Economy. We have the aspiration to deliver net zero CO2 concrete globally by 2050, which will contribute to the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings and climate resilient infrastructures.

CEMEX has also committed to reduce its indirect electricity GHG emissions (scope 2) by 42% by 2030 from a 2020 base year.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cClimate action is the biggest challenge of our times. CEMEX is taking decisive action to address it by defining ambitious emissions reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative and executing against those targets,\u201d said Fernando A.

CEMEX is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Under its Future in Action program, CEMEX announced a climate action target of below 475 kg CO2, a &gt;40% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. The company´s clean electricity consumption will also increase from the current 29% in 2020 to 55% by 2030.

The two key objectives of the Bank Station Capacity Upgrade project are to increase capacity at the station and minimise journey times. More than 1200m of new tunnels have already been built, including three new escalator barrels.<br />\nCEMEX was contracted to provide high quality primary lining spray concrete for use in the construction of shafts, tunnels and cross passages, with four 100 tonne silos on site for storage. This job has presented particular challenges because of its location in a very busy area of London, while the station itself is remaining operational throughout construction.&nbsp;<br />\nDeliveries must be booked in advance and precisely timed, following pre-agreed routes through the City of London. However, there are still many pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users using the area at all times, which present a considerable risk that must be closely managed. CEMEX worked closely with Dragados to design a site layout which enabled regular delivery of dry silo materials while minimising disruption to the traffic or pedestrians.<br />\nThe project requires strategic management and coordination by CEMEX\u2019s plant, silo, supply chain and booking teams to ensure product is produced and delivered safely and to schedule.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, the mix supplied is extremely complicated, consisting of eight separate constituents which when combined give strength of +60N/mm2, consistence of 600mm flow and a workability retention of two hours. This mix has been used on several high-profile London projects over the last seven years including the Northern Line Extension and Thames Tideway.<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, commented: \u201cSupplying the Bank station development has presented considerable challenges, particularly around access, but we are very proud of the dedication of our team to ensuring the specific mix of concrete was produced and safely delivered to meet the customer\u2019s requirements.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cIt is a privilege to be part of such a major construction project in our capital city and the spray concrete we have created has become renowned across the industry for its high quality and exceptional finish.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX manufactures the product at a dedicated spray concrete plant from where it is transported into central London.

In a few hours, seven teams of five to six volunteers managed to break the daily harvesting record with 1,162 kg of olives harvested. Almost 6.5 tonnes of olives were collected, from which 900 litres of eco-certified extra virgin olive oil will be produced. CEMEX also involved students from two local community primary schools to help with the olive harvest.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, restored quarries in CEMEX\u2019s Spanish operation provided additional examples of successful horticulture and environmental enrichment from productive restoration. The former \u2018El Clotet\u2019 quarry in Alicante, Spain, is now a 138-hectare agricultural holding with more than 55,000 fruit trees. The farm has started to collect more than 2,000 tonnes of citrus fruits for the national and export market, beginning in October and running until May.<br />\nRafael Sempere, head of CEMEX's agricultural division in Spain, explained: \u201cThis restored quarry is an example of a sustainable, environmentally friendly farm that uses the latest irrigation techniques to avoid wasting a single drop of water, a very valuable resource in Spain.\u201d<br />\nAnother pioneering project is CEMEX\u2019s vineyard, located in the former quarry of the Yepes cement factory near Toledo. Thirty hectares of land and 92,000 plants of the best grape varieties are cultivated in a restored natural environment. The production of grapes and wine from this site demonstrates how properly restored industrial land can provide agricultural production of benefit to both the local community and the natural habitat.<br />\nAndrew Spencer, VP of Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX EMEA added: \u201cWe recognise that our industry has consequences for the environment, but CEMEX is working hard to actively counteract climate change and this drive is present through all aspects of our business. In our cement and aggregate quarrying operations across Europe, we restore and recultivate our sites to provide optimal conditions that are managed well to deliver for biodiversity. The recent harvests in Croatia and Spain in particular demonstrate how valuable this can be, both for wildlife and for local communities. Our vision is of a successful, sustainable CEMEX that makes a positive contribution to people and the environment.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX takes responsibility for the environment in its operations by improving management systems, reducing emissions, protecting biodiversity, and restoring worked-out quarries to nature and agriculture.

If the proposed extension is permitted by the County Council and gravel extraction begins in this area, the resulting lake, though larger than the one being formed by the existing scheme, would only occupy a small part of Fish Meadow.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe proposed lake would not affect the holding of future festivals on the meadow, and in fact the owner sees it as an enhancement that will make the site a more attractive venue. For the short time work is in progress there will be some inconvenience but it is the ambition of all parties concerned that this is minimised with the least effect on the festivals.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are working closely with Upton Rowing Club and other stakeholders and hope that the lake could be imaginatively and sensitivity managed to enhance the site for the benefit of the whole local area.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (\u201cCEMEX\u201d) and COBOD International (\u201cCOBOD\u201d), a global leader in construction-grade 3D printers, announced today the introduction of a 3D printing solution that utilizes conventional ready-mix concrete in the building process. The solution allows for a reduction in time and significant savings versus traditional construction and other 3D printing methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>Utilizing an innovative admixture, CEMEX and COBOD developed a solution for 3D printing that enables the use of conventional concrete, allowing the consumption of local and readily available materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current 3D printing methods rely on highly specialized and expensive mortars. CEMEX introduced a proprietary admixtures family called D.fab, which transforms conventional concrete into a versatile material that can be efficiently tailored for 3D printing construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>This admixtures innovation produces a more fluid and malleable concrete that facilitates the pouring process for 3D printing applications. COBOD\u2019s printers and expertise, in combination with the admixtures, make it possible for the concrete to gain shape instantaneously. COBOD applied the new solution for the first time in a suburb of Luanda, the capital of Angola, where homebuilder Power2Build used it to construct Angola\u2019s first 3D printed concrete house.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe introduction of this revolutionary 3D printing system is a testament to our customer-centric mindset and relentless focus on continuous innovation and improvement. Working together with COBOD, we have developed an experience for customers that is superior to anything that has been provided in the past,\u201d said Juan Romero, Executive Vice President Sustainability, Commercial, and Operations Development of CEMEX. \u201cOur innovation efforts position us at the forefront of new technologies that contribute to building a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo address the world´s affordable housing needs requires not only a technology that can build faster, but also materials that are as economical as ordinary concrete. With this solution, the strength and quality of concrete combined with the speed and automation of 3D printing, we can help solve the affordable housing crisis in Angola and elsewhere,\u201d said Ricardo Almeida, CEO of Power2Build.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cCOBOD began 3D construction printing back in 2017, and 3D printed Europe\u2019s first 3D printed building, we made the concrete recipe ourselves. We had to use much cement to get the material to work, with the consequence that our recipe was not as efficient as we aspired. However, we continued to look for a solution with ordinary concrete, which is critical for the mass application of our technology. We are more than pleased that CEMEX took on the challenge and proud that we cooperated to develop the new solution,\u201d said Henrik Lund-Nielsen, Founder &amp; General Manager of COBOD International.<\/p>\n\n<p>About COBOD<br />\nCOBOD International A/S, Denmark, is a construction robotics and automation company in hypergrowth with +70 employees.

Its goal is to inspire a new meaning for the role of CFOs as the architects of long- term sustainable value creation by raising awareness of the transformative impact of corporate finance across financial markets, the global economy and society as a whole. It also aspires to create a market for corporate SDG investments and finance that is sufficiently diverse and transparent to channel trillions of dollars of financial investments towards effective private-sector solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals. The CFO Taskforce provides CFOs with a platform to share ideas, develop new concepts and frameworks, and provide recommendations to unlock private capital and create a market for mainstream SDG investments.

This has been a fantastic experience having previously struggled to find sea time to complete my training due to COVID-19. As the months passed, it looked less and less likely that I would be able qualify in the next few years, despite having completed my Foundation Degree in Marine Engineering at nautical college. However, through my mentor from the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, Captain Matt Bland, I had the opportunity to join this vessel and complete my training.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the early stages of my cadetship I spent some time on a deep-sea containership. Although I found this interesting, it was not necessarily a good learning environment. In comparison, CEMEX UK Marine has been an excellent organisation in which to learn my trade. Not only have I made good progress on the completion of my Training Record Book, but the crew have been actively willing to teach me in a way I haven\u2019t encountered before.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, I think this vessel is an excellent learning environment for cadets. In a matter of weeks I have experienced a variety of engine room maintenance procedures, emergency drills, maintenance on deck machinery and even observed some bridge operations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I have been impressed with the procedures at CEMEX, which create a safe environment to work in. I have also had the chance to assist in the completion of crucial documentation including Permits to Work and Lock-Out paperwork under the supervision of the Chief Engineer. Having not come across the important initiatives like \u201cStep In\u201d, Near-Miss Hazard Alert Cards and Work Safe Risk Assessments on a vessel before, I can see how these contribute to the excellent safety culture at CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would like to give thanks to Matt, the Officers and Crew, and CEMEX UK for this fantastic opportunity. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of my time onboard!\u201d<\/p>"

Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln and they are responsible for approximately 40% of direct CO2 emissions of the process. Replacing fossil fuels entirely with solar energy is a gamechanger in the industry\u2019s efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cThe production of the first solar clinker is an exciting milestone for this transformational technology.

Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. \u201cCEMEX is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The Synhelion and CEMEX R&amp;D teams set up a pilot batch production unit to produce clinker from concentrated solar radiation by connecting the clinker production process with the Synhelion solar receiver. The pilot was installed at the Very High Concentration Solar Tower of IMDEA Energy, located in Spain. Synhelion\u2019s solar receiver delivers record-breaking temperatures reaching beyond 1,500°C. The solar receiver heats a gaseous heat transfer fluid and thus provides the necessary process heat for clinker production.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur technology converts concentrated sunlight into the hottest existing solar process heat \u2013 beyond 1,500°C \u2013 on the market,\u201d said Dr. Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. \u201cWe are proud to demonstrate together with CEMEX one specific industrially relevant application of our fully renewable, high-temperature solar heat.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The pilot is the first successful calcination and, more importantly, the first successful clinkerization ever achieved using only solar energy. The clinker was used to produce cement and was then further processed to produce concrete. In the next phase of their joint research and development project, CEMEX and Synhelion aim to produce solar clinker in larger quantities as they work towards an industrial scale pilot at a cement plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>This initiative is part of CEMEX\u2019s Future in Action program, which focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of its operations and products to deliver globally net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050.

One in six young driver will become involved in a crash within their first two years of driving. This is of great concern to the local authorities, emergency services and most certainly to parents of young drivers and vulnerable road users. To this end, CEMEX SDSA Warwickshire is designed to address these issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>SDSA is fast paced, balancing educational content with real life evidence, factually presented, holding the audience\u2019s attention throughout. It uses testimonies from officers in the emergency services about their real experiences in dealing with the aftermath of serious road crashes; from crash survivors and the bereaved. It also covers Safer and Healthy Mobility, a new section on other forms of transportation used by young people.<\/p>\n\n<p>This year\u2019s event was organised by Rugby resident George Atkinson, a road safety campaigner since his daughter was killed as a pedestrian in London in 1998. George would like to thank CEMEX for their sponsorship and Rugby School for allowing their students to witness this life saving road safety show.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"CEMEX is committed to protecting the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable road users and we feel very honoured to sponsor this year\u2019s Safe Drive Stay Alive event, an impactful and important show that could help to save lives. We recognise the vulnerability of new and young drivers and we hope that this programme will go a long way in influencing the behaviours which can lead to a generation of risk averse drivers.\"<br />\n<strong>Chiedza Mupfumira, Social Impact Specialist for CEMEX UK<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\"It is always a privilege to support George and Giulietta in their tireless and effective campaigning for greater road safety.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX\u2019s key building products plant at Northfleet in Kent has made significant inroads over the last 12 months. This follows on from the recent launch of ReadyBlock Zero, the UK\u2019s first zero carbon concrete block, as CEMEX\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions business continues to improve the sustainability of its operations in line with the company\u2019s global Future In Action strategy, which is committed to Net Zero CO2 in concrete by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>Production equipment at Northfleet has been upgraded through a £100k CapEx investment to enable increased supply and ongoing maintenance. &nbsp;The new high-strength banding process means that plastic hoods are no longer required on dense and lightweight bricks and concrete blocks. As a result, Northfleet has eradicated 6.1 tonnes of plastic, or the equivalent of over 65,000 plastic water bottles, per year from its traditional plastic packaging process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to plastic reduction, Northfleet is continuing to make environmental savings in timber by increasing the volume of void packs which reduces the volume of &nbsp;timber palleted products. &nbsp;Over 100 tonnes of timber \u2013 roughly the equivalent of 100 ten foot high oak trees \u2013 was saved in 2021 and it is expected this figure will increase further in 2022. The programme is further supported by CEMEX\u2019s pallet recovery scheme which works with merchants and distributors to recycle and reduce timber waste across the supply chain to make greater environmental efficiencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nDamien Allen, Business Manager, Building Products UK, CEMEX, comments: \u201cWe have been pushing a more sustainable approach to our packaging in Concrete Products. &nbsp;At our Northfleet plant, our results so far are very encouraging. We expect our usage of plastic and timber to reduce further dramatically in 2022 due to the upgraded process.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur &nbsp;equipment meets the highest quality requirements. It is extremely reliable, requires little maintenance, and is highly energy-efficient as well. We are looking at lots of different options to continuously improve our packaging, without compromising product quality. This includes a constant watching eye on recycled materials and our approach to repair and re-use across the plant, in line with the circular economy mindset.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Climate Action strategy aims to lead the way in the construction industry and has an overall global ambition of delivering net zero carbon emissions in concrete by 2050.

        "Display Title": "New CEMEX ONPOINT Mortar Injects Colour into Offsite Construction and Urban Building Design",
        "Body": "<p>Developed to complement and enhance the design and aesthetics of any architectural or urban scheme, CEMEX ONPOINT is a factory-produced mortar available in over 35 consistent colour palette options, effectively complementing a wide range of masonry products and existing mortar. Guaranteed to not fade and providing high levels of resistance in extreme exposure, CEMEX ONPOINT is suitable for multi-use applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This new product is ideal for offsite and precast panel construction for commercial development, modular housing and residential high rise, as well as for restoration and retrofit projects. The high performance mortar is formulated for gun injection application, providing an additional sustainability benefit by reducing waste and labour costs. It allows quick and efficient pointing of brick inlay systems and brick slip panels, and is equally effective for matching and repointing existing brickwork. Offsite production is seen by many as a more sustainable method of construction because everything is made under strict factory conditions, allowing optimisation of the process and the most efficient use of materials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Mike May, Sales Manager for Mortars Europe, comments: \u201cWe\u2019re continuously looking at how we can enhance the performance, durability and consistency of our mortars to meet market demand. The off-site market is booming, but precast manufacturers and architectural specifiers are limited in their choice of mortars. The arrival of CEMEX ONPOINT now enables precast manufacturers and specialist designers the ability to dramatically enhance aesthetics and increase the kerb appeal of their buildings via quick and easy gun injction application, which also cuts down on wasted material.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur wide range of colours also make CEMEX ONPOINT the ideal mortar to support sustainable retrofit and restoration. On heritage projects we can now accurately colour-match existing mortars for repointing and maintenance work. Our existing buildings account for more than 35% of the world\u2019s energy consumption, so solutions like CEMEX ONPOINT can significantly contribute to a more efficient built environment and a better future for all.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>All CEMEX Mortars comply with the requirements of BS EN 998-2 and the complete range of masonry mortars have been verified against a prescribed range of initial type tests such as durability, bond strength, fire protection and strength criteria.<\/p>\n\n<p>ONPOINT is the latest addition to CEMEX\u2019s broader Urbanisation Solutions business, which is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on the Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/onpoint-coloured-pointing-mortar\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/onpoint-coloured-pointing-mortar<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

It is funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, and the project team comprises leading industrial, technology, and research &amp; development partners.<\/p>\n\n<p>The project seeks to isolate the carbon produced from the clinker manufacturing process, resulting in a concentrated CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;that can be easily captured and possibly stored. This indirect calcination technology may be powered by electricity generated from renewable sources, significantly reducing the need for fossil fuels in the cement production process.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX has played a crucial role in defining and solving the main technical challenges for the project in the front-end engineering design phase. CEMEX is also supporting the consortium in identifying and procuring the optimal equipment and technology for the project.<\/p>\n\n<p>Drawing on its significant experience in alternative fuel usage, CEMEX has also been tapped to validate the technology used in the combustion trials to generate the required thermal heat required in the LEILAC 2 project.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"As a climate action leader in our industry, we focus on developing the emerging technologies we need to achieve our net-zero CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;goal. While our roadmap to 2030 relies on existing solutions, LEILAC 2 is an important example of our commitment to work with partners to develop and scale the new technologies that will move the industry to carbon neutrality,\" said Roberto Ponguta, CEMEX Vice-president of Global Operations, Technical and Energy. \"As part of our Future in Action program, we are developing industrial-scale projects looking to use technologies that capture CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;most efficiently.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About LEILAC<\/strong><br />\nThe LEILAC consortium is led by the LEILAC Group (technology provider Calix).

Crucial is the action site has undertaken on monitoring and removal of invasive weeds and identification of non-native plants to controlled and removed as required. The site doesn\u2019t use herbicide or insecticide to protect nearby waterways and help preserve invertebrates.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Much of this area is known as an Open Mosaic Habitat; a valuable habitat that can develop on previous industrial / brownfield sites. As a former shipyard and aggregate recycling facility, the site supports a diverse range of pollinators, which in turn assists the recovery of biodiversity more generally in the local area <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">\u2013<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\"> which some people would find surprising given its former use! <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">It\u2019s rich in wildflower species and home to native bumblebee species, butterflies and daytime moths you would expect to see in much more established meadows. The team have seen notable butterfly species such as Dingy Skipper and Wall Brown. Both species have been reported through the National Biodiversity Network and a list of butterfly species spotted on site has been sent to the NGO Butterfly Conservation. The site is also home to nine species of native bumblebee which not only supports biodiversity at the site but also helps establish a local nature network to expand into surrounding areas.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Being close to the northeast coast, sea buckthorn scrub, has established in some areas on site. This is used by nesting songbirds during spring and summer and the seeds provide a food source for the birds well into the winter. The team are delighted to see Herring Gulls, which have been in decline nationally, successfully nesting every year. They ensure that nesting seabirds remain undisturbed as part of their BMP. The red listed Kittiwake and protected Arctic Terns have also been spotted on site as they nest on the nearby Tyne Bridge. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Well done to all those at the site and in the UK Sustainability team who are working hard to enhance Jarrow Wharf\u2019s biodiversity. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">If you\u2019d like to find out more about the BAP at Jarrow Wharf, or have any other questions about BMPs, please contact Jenny Oldroyd at the RSPB or Sean Cassidy. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>"

CEMEX\u2019s Research and Development area continued to develop the concept. Recently, the team has achieved promising results, a carbon conversion rate of 50%, in a lab setting. The next step is to scale the technology in a cement plant pilot within a year. A key pillar of CEMEX\u2019s flagship decarbonization program, Future in Action, is discovering and investing in scalable technologies and innovations to achieve carbon neutrality.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis breakthrough technology is significant for CEMEX, not only because it offers the potential to commercialize carbon emissions, but because it demonstrates the value of our&nbsp;<strong>Smart Innovation<\/strong>&nbsp;platform,\u201d said Fernando A.

        "Body": "<p>As an alternative to steel mesh construction on large scale projects, such as roads and bridges, airports and taxiways, including internal floors, the Macro fibres in CEMEX Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete provides high levels of performance in reinforcement, without compromising on quality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>According to latest figures compiled by The Department for Business and Industrial Trade Strategy, the cost of concrete-reinforcing bars has risen by 43.6 per cent year on year, while the price of fabricated structural steel has risen by 35.9 per cent. This comes on top of rising costs labour and fuel costs across the supply chain, forcing many to be more discerning when making specification, procurement and purchasing decisions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete enables mesh-free reinforcement, without the need for traditional reinforcing bars. It provides a range of comprehensive benefits to the contractor, with faster, safer and more cost-effective construction, alongside the added potential to reduce CO2, by saving on overall embodied carbon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete is designed to enhance post-crack performance and increase impact and abrasion resistance, as well as flexural strength. Fibres are distributed evenly through the mix unlike mesh reinforcement, which requires exact positioning to be effective.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Reinforcing without steel mesh, can save contractors storage and labour time. The reinforcement process means less waste, as concrete is mixed and supplied to exacting standards for the level of reinforcement required and in the right quantities to meet the technical specification of each job. The concrete fibre product is delivered in traditional Readymix vehicles straight to site in a single operation, removing the need for additional specialist equipment and cutting and fixing on site. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete is manufactured to BS EN ISO 9001 and is independently certified under the quality scheme for Ready Mixed Concrete (QSRMC). The fibre mix concrete is carefully controlled and quality-assured in Readymix plants throughout the UK.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX provides bespoke fibre concrete, in both macro and micro and steel Readymix solutions, along with expert technical assistance to ensure quality products are developed for corrosive ground conditions, extreme weather conditions and high strength requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>To find out more about CEMEX\u2019s complete range of Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete visit<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/advanced-fibre-reinforced-concrete\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/advanced-fibre-reinforced-concrete<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Statistics compiled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show that the cost of concrete-reinforcing bars has risen by 43.6 per cent year on year, while the price of fabricated structural steel has jumped by 35.9 per cent. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b>What can contractors who usually rely on steel to reinforce concrete do? <\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Fibres offer the ideal alternative for those who need to lay a durable concrete that provides resistance to cracking but want to minimise their use of steel. There are two types of fibre:<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left:8px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Micro fibres: CEMEX recommends micro fibres for domestic applications, such as paving, foundations, driveways and garage floors, although they are not exclusively used here. These reduce the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking, provide a tougher surface and make concrete more durable<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Macro fibres: CEMEX recommends macro fibres for larger, commercial applications, including internal floors, warehousing, docklands, roads and bridges, airports and taxiways, although again they are not exclusively used here. Macro fibres can offer increased flexural strength, provide post-crack performance plus greater impact and abrasion resistance.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Fibres can be particularly impactful when considering the amount of steel that would generally be required for these applications.

Ian encouraged the children to consider the waste that is created every day and the opportunities the circular economy can present to reduce this. &nbsp;<br />\nRugby is the location of CEMEX\u2019s main UK cement plant, which has been part of the town since the 19th Century. CEMEX strives to be a positive member of the local community and works closely with several schools and groups.<br />\nChiedza Mupfumira, Social Impact Specialist for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s vital that we encourage our children and young people to understand the challenges we face as a result of climate change and empower them to protect the world of the future. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe were very impressed by the enthusiasm and attentiveness of the children \u2013 they easily grasped the concept of a circular economy and how it can benefit us all. We would like to extend a big thank you to Boughton Leigh Junior School, in particular Mr Gaskell who supported us on the day and all the children who participated.\u201d<br />\nMark Pawsey MP said: \u201cThe interest our young people have in protecting the environment is always very clear and the pupils at Boughton Leigh Junior School were no exception. I was delighted to be able to talk to them about the role which both the government, local businesses and individuals have to play in reusing, reducing and recycling, and CEMEX\u2019s new online learning tools and their game is a great way to engage with kids about building a circular economy. We all need to do more to help the environment and it was really positive to see both the next generation and one of Rugby\u2019s leading businesses working together to do so.\u201d<br />\nPaula Duynstee, Head Teacher at Boughton Leigh Junior School, added: \u201cThe children and staff of Boughton Leigh Junior School were very proud to be invited to take part in this initiative from CEMEX. Having been supported on numerous occasions by their community programme, we thought that it would be a well thought out and worthwhile endeavour, which it was. The children (and staff) were all very excited by the event and enjoyed taking part immensely. We are very proud of our school and the wider experiences and work ethic we offer, so to engage with the wider workforce was an amazing experience for the children, and one of which we will gladly take part again.\u201d<br />\nCllr Ian Courts, Leader of Solihull Borough Council, and Portfolio Holder for Environment at the West Midlands Combined Authority, said: \u201cI was happy to send over a video to support CEMEX\u2019s work with children to highlight the issue of climate change and how they see the circular economy as a way to minimise waste. &nbsp;The issue here is the increasing scarcity of natural resources and how a tiny fraction actually get re-used. &nbsp;We need to reduce our waste and adapt to reuse our materials wherever we can. Our young people can help us create a circular economy as they build their careers and live their lives.<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important that businesses get involved in this work by signing up to the net zero pledge and by helping to educate our children, and the wider public, on how we can all play a part in tackling climate change. I hope the pupils at Boughton Leigh Junior School enjoyed the session and look for to many more children getting a chance to understand how using the ideas of a circular economy can help us all tackle climate change.<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s educational program A Circular World features a fictional team of young people across the globe who need the help of participants to solve different environmental problems.

Utilising rail over road for this material offers a considerable saving in CO2, an equivalent of 31kt. Meanwhile, in France the business grew the tonnage of aggregates and landfill moved by river barge by 9%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Across the channel, the UK saw a 3% rise in rail freight volumes. This saved 143,000 road movements and consequently nearly 17kt of CO2 from being released into the air. Since 2012, CEMEX has increased the amount transported by rail freight in its UK operation by 50%. Finally, Spain has grown its export-import volumes moved by ship by over 50% in just one year, an incredible result.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Matt Wild, VP of Supply Chain for CEMEX EMEA, commented: \u201cWe have been clear in our intention to cut the carbon emissions generated through our supply chain by accelerating a modal shift from road to rail, river and sea freight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is therefore very satisfying to see how much our European operations have increased their use of these over the past year, helped by our continued investment into these networks; such as opening a new rail depot in Birmingham, UK.

        "Body": "<p>The Sandwell Aquatic Centre is the only brand-new building for the Games, which are being held in Birmingham. The project brief for the centre was to create three state-of-the-art pools, a 50m Olympic-sized competition pool, a 25m dive pool and a community pool, along with the construction of the plant room and the perimeter ground slabs.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX provided some 3,000m3 of concrete for use in the pools\u2019 creation, which had to be carefully poured to an accuracy of mere millimetres to comply with Olympic standards. The team worked closely with sub-contractor AJ Morrisroe to develop a detailed pour sequence to manage concrete shrinkage and achieve a water retaining structure in line with the project specification.<\/p>\n\n<p>Due to the requirements of the project schedule, different phases of construction overlapped and at various stages digging, waterproofing, steel working, forming, and pouring may have happened at the same time. This meant close planning for the pours, which were completed at up to 400m³ each time and took place every seven days in a chequerboard approach to allow the concrete to fully cure, was vital.<\/p>\n\n<p>Richard Kershaw, Technical Manager for CEMEX, commented: \u201cWe were proud to have the opportunity to support the development work taking place in Birmingham as part of the upcoming Commonwealth Games. Our wide range of concrete options allows us to design and produce the perfect watertight and resilient mix for the new Aquatics Centre, and we were pleased to work closely with AJ Morrisroe to ensure the project schedule remained on track.\u201d<br />\nFollowing the Commonwealth games the Aquatics Centre will be open to the public, offering the residents of Sandwell a new state of the art leisure centre focusing on the health and wellbeing of the community.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about CEMEX\u2019s waterproof concrete solutions, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/permatite-waterproof-concrete\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/permatite-waterproof-concrete<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>These new additions are the latest stage of the restoration work that is taking place at the site. The cattle will perform a valuable role, providing low-intensity grazing that is better for wildlife and reduces the need for mechanical mowing and the use of weedkiller.<br />\nUsing cattle for grazing helps to encourage biodiversity in restored land and it is hoped that over time it will help to improve the habitat available in the restored areas of Willington. This area covers three worked out gravel pits, which are now native grassland.&nbsp;<br />\nLong-term, the restoration of Willington will produce a great wetland location with ponds, fen and wet grassland along with vital wet woodland that rare species such as Willow Tit depend on, complimenting the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust\u2019s site which sits alongside the quarry.<br />\nCEMEX sees the restoration of its quarries as a vital part of its environmental efforts, as part of its dedicated sustainability strategy; Future in Action. It works closely with partner the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to ensure Biodiversity Management Plans are in place at its UK quarries. To date, CEMEX has restored more than 1000 hectares of priority habitat across the UK.&nbsp;<br />\nBill Newton, Quarry Manager at Willington, said \u201cIt\u2019s important that when our work is finished at the quarry, the land is restored to a high standard so it can be an asset to the local community and a home for many diverse wildlife species.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been keen to introduce cattle to the site for some time and I\u2019m very happy that they have now arrived with us. We\u2019re excited to see how they can positively impact the biodiversity of the restored areas and the habitat available \u2013 and they certainly help make the landscape even more picturesque!\u201d<br />\nFor more information about CEMEX, visit www.cemex.com&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Through this partnership, they recently introduced the first ever 3D printing solution that utilizes conventional ready-mix concrete in the building process. The solution can deliver significant savings versus traditional 3D printing construction methods and materials and has been implemented in several geographies. Through this investment, CEMEX will strengthen its ability to use 3D printing technology and add another avenue to address housing needs. CEMEX and COBOD also intend to further develop innovative material solutions and building performance enhancements for 3D printing applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current 3D printing construction methods rely on highly specialized and expensive mortars. CEMEX introduced a proprietary admixtures family called D.fab, which allows conventional concrete to be efficiently tailored for 3D printing construction. This admixtures innovation produces a more fluid and easier to pump concrete that facilitates 3D printing applications. COBOD\u2019s printers and expertise, in combination with the admixtures, make it possible to implement a more efficient process that requires less material and utilizes any concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe investment in COBOD reflects our customer-centric mindset and relentless focus on continuous innovation and improvement. Working with COBOD, CEMEX developed a customer experience in 3D printing construction that is superior to anything that has been provided in the past,\u201d said Gonzalo Galindo, Head of CEMEX Ventures. \u201cOur innovation efforts position us at the forefront of new technologies that contribute to building a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am proud to have CEMEX, a global leader in the building materials industry, join us as an investor along with our other shareholders PERI and GE Renewable Energy.

        "Body": "<p>Based in the UK, Carbon8 Systems is a leader in the permanent capture of CO2 and mineralization of thermal residues to create carbon-infused, sustainable products. The company developed a patented chemical process called Accelerated Carbonation Technology (\"ACT\") where industrial residues are treated with captured CO2 emissions to transform them into valuable, low-carbon products.<\/p>\n\n<p>ACT has made significant contributions to the circular economy for more than 10 years, delivering commercial and environmental benefits that include diverting waste from landfills, permanently capturing CO2 and replacing carbon-intensive products with low-carbon, sustainable alternatives. ACT is applied to several industries, including cement, waste to energy, biomass, among others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both CEMEX and Carbon8 Systems recognize the benefit of mineralization as a carbon sink. Therefore, they may explore the application of the technology to different byproducts as well as the manufacturing of products such as alternative aggregates and supplementary cementitious materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under the initiative, Carbon8 Systems will evaluate CEMEX byproducts and how they can be used to develop low-carbon or even carbon-negative products through ACT. The initial focus of the program will be to assess byproducts from CEMEX's Rüdersdorf cement plant in Germany and Rugby cement plant in the UK. They will also evaluate the suitability of a lightweight aggregate product created from the byproducts for sale in each market. The program could later be deployed to other CEMEX cement sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"This initiative with Carbon8 Systems is another example of the work we are doing with partners across industries, academia, and startups to tap into the latest innovation and disruptive technologies to achieve our ambition of delivering net-zero CO2 concrete globally to all of our customers,\" said Juan Romero, Executive Vice President Sustainability, Commercial, and Operations Development of CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>John Pilkington, Chief Executive of Carbon8 Systems, said: \u201cWe are delighted that CEMEX has asked us to work with them; our carbonation technology, demonstrated at cement plants in Europe and Canada, offers CEMEX and the global cement industry a proven CCUS solution.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>This effort is part of CEMEX's roadmap for its ambitious climate action goals, including delivering globally net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050. This is one of several initiatives under the company's Future in Action program, which includes investing in promising technologies that the company will need to achieve its goal of net-zero concrete by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>About Carbon8 Systems<\/p>\n\n<p>ACT relies on a process of carbonation. This process occurs naturally under atmospheric conditions. If left in the open, compounds such as calcium or magnesium oxides, hydroxides, or silicates will react with the carbon dioxide. However, in nature, this process takes millennia. C8S\u2019 technology accelerates this process in a controlled way and in doing so, has created one of the worlds few economically-viable forms of carbonation and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU). The ACT process mineralises and stabilises these industrial by-products or residues to produce a granular solid. C8S\u2019 expertise around the carbonation process means that it is able to control the physical characteristics of the end-product. The end-product has various valuable applications, such as aggregates for construction, or agricultural fertiliser.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CO2ntainer system (a modular, containerised solution \u2013 carbon capture in a box) is similar in size to a shipping container so can be easily transported by HGV to site.<\/p>\n\n<p>John Pilkington has held a number of non-executive director roles and was previously a director of Ove Arup &amp; Partners and then Carillion plc and Amey plc for over 30 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2017, the company was awarded the Queens Award for Enterprise \u2013 Innovation, and its work has received support from Innovate UK and the State of Ontario in Canada.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

So far, 300 metres of track at Salford has been replaced along with new ballast, with a further 300 metres planned for this year.&nbsp;<br />\nIn addition, improvements to the storage bays now mean that for the first time, carriages can travel the full length of the storage shed, utilising all 10 bays.&nbsp;<br />\nAs a result, the site can now receive hardstone deliveries from South Wales every two weeks by rail, as opposed to using trucks; reducing road movements and offering additional sustainability benefits. These upgrades also ensure increased safety during transportation and discharge.&nbsp;<br />\nDavid Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK &amp; France, commented: \u201cThis investment into our railhead at Salford is part of a national four-year programme to raise safety standards across our UK rail operation. We expect to spend a similar figure every year, with work also completed at our Dove Holes site last year.\u201d<br />\nThe improvements at Salford are further complemented by the introduction of new CEMEX-branded wagons, operated in partnership with GB Railfreight. These attractive wagons are regularly used alongside The CEMEX Express, the Class 66 Locomotive unveiled in June 2019.&nbsp;<br />\nDave added: \u201cRail is an integral component of our supply chain strategy meaning we are investing into our network to ensure it boasts industry-leading safety standards and operates efficiently. As we look to grow our transport by rail in order to maximise the time, capacity and efficiency benefits it offers, this expenditure will allow us to increase our rail deliveries into Salford; all while using stylish CEMEX-liveried wagons!\u201d<br />\nJohn Smith, Managing Director of GB Railfreight said: \u201cWe are delighted to continue our partnership with CEMEX. The introduction of new wagons earlier this year and CEMEX\u2019s commitment to supporting rail freight is very exciting, especially considering the need to reduce carbon emissions.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cOur services have already removed a considerable number of trucks from the road, helping to ensure operations are carried out it the most sustainability way.

        "Body": "<p>This contract will see Walsh running barges on the River Thames to transport aggregates from CEMEX\u2019s wharf at Dagenham to its readymix plant at Fulham with a 75% CO2 saving compared to road transport. It further demonstrates CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action commitment to net zero CO2, with an equivalent saving of more than 5,000 lorry movements.<br />\nMarine aggregates are processed at Dagenham and the site also receives limestone by sea from the company\u2019s Raynes Quarry in North Wales. Both materials are used in the Fulham plant to produce concrete that is supplied into the London market.<br />\nThis contract will transport CEMEX materials on the Thames with one barge service completed every day. The use of a river barge to transport these materials takes trucks off the road, helping to ease congestion and reduce emissions; each loaded barge carries 400 tonnes which saves the equivalent of 20 HGV lorries travelling across the centre of London.<br />\nThis contract with Walsh has been agreed as CEMEX prepares to invest in its Fulham Readymix site to ensure it can continue to meet demand for construction materials in the capital into the long-term. Opportunities to develop the partnership with Walsh further, including the identification of additional flows, are being explored.<br />\nDave Hart, CEMEX Supply Chain Director for UK and France, commented: \u201cWe are pleased to have agreed this new partnership with Walsh, who are perfectly placed to support us with the supply of materials into our Fulham site. We are always looking for ways to enhance the sustainability of our logistics operation, and the use of river freight supports our drive to be a responsible business by reducing congestion and air emissions in our great capital city.\u201d<br />\nLex Russell, Materials Director for CEMEX UK, added: \u201cOur Fulham readymix plant is a vital part of our London operation so it is important that it receives a consistent and reliable flow of materials from our Dagenham Wharf. Using the Thames provides a congestion-free, sustainable route through the centre of London and maximising the opportunities for river freight was encouraged in the Greater London Authority\u2019s strategic plan for the city.\u201d<br />\nJoe Gifford, Managing Director of Walsh, said: \u201cThis is a win-win, not just for CEMEX and Walsh, but also for freight transport, construction and the environment. Moving essential materials via the River Thames has numerous advantages \u2013 reducing lorry miles, less congestion, lower emissions \u2013 whilst at the same time helping to meet London\u2019s demand for materials for redevelopment and regeneration. We\u2019re proud to be working with the team at CEMEX to deliver that.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. \"Hydrogen is a key technology for our Future in Action program, as an accelerator for our efforts to transform waste into energy and as a potential carbon-free fuel source.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s current leveraging of hydrogen technology includes its injection into kilns to optimize the combustion process and increase the use of alternative fuels. Both are essential levers for the company's 2030 goal to reduce CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;emissions in the cement production process by approximately 40%. In the first half of 2022, CEMEX increased its use of alternative fuels by 5 percentage points, reaching an all-time-high 33% substitution rate.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a pioneer in the adoption of hydrogen technology in the building materials industry, with successful projects running since 2019. As of 2021, the company used hydrogen in all its European plants and expects to continue scaling its use in other operations worldwide.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is also working with several partners to discover and pilot breakthrough technologies for hydrogen to be used as zero-carbon primary fuel source in cement production. Among its major innovation projects is a partnership with Hiiroc, a leader in technology for low-cost, zero-emission hydrogen generation. The company also participated in the creation of the first renewable hydrogen industrial plant in Spain in collaboration with Acciona and Enagas.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

By investing in more efficient, more sustainable vehicles CEMEX demonstrates again its commitment to decarbonisation of all aspects of its operations, and the management of its logistics fleet is central to this.<br />\nThese vehicles all meet Transport for London\u2019s Direct Vision Standard (DVS) rating, thanks to their enhanced safety features. These include a side-scan system, while visual alerts are displayed on the windscreen if something is moving into the vehicle\u2019s danger zone.<br />\nFurthermore, each truck\u2019s cab features raised A-pillars that give it up to one extra cubic metre of space and more light. A large windscreen, low door line and modern mirrors ensures excellent all-round visibility which is improved further with an added lower window on each passenger door.<br />\nNigel Ponton, Fleet Engineering Manager for CEMEX UK, said: \u201cThe addition of these new trucks to our fleet will enable us to better meet customer demand, safely and efficiently. Safety is the number one focus whenever we add new trucks to our operation and these Volvos tick every box in that respect. One of the reasons why these vehicles stood out for CEMEX was because of the improved visibility and layout of the day cabs \u2013 providing an ideal workplace for our drivers whilst aiding the safety of other road users.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThese trucks will all be working in busy streets across London so it\u2019s imperative we provide our drivers with the best tools possible to do the job and help protect any vulnerable road users. Moreover, thanks to the improved fuel efficiencies and enhanced payload these new Volvos are the most sustainable vehicles we\u2019ve ever had and will help decarbonise our delivery footprint.\u201d<br />\nFor more information about CEMEX\u2019s sustainable logistics efforts, visit https://www.cemex.co.uk/sustainablelogistics.aspx&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>From energy efficiency and charging infrastructure investments to hydrogen trials, green tech and wetland restoration projects, today\u2019s report argues that low carbon and nature restoration projects can deliver key benefits in terms of employment, greater regional equality, long-term competitiveness and resilience.<br />\nThe briefing contains a wide range of case studies from Aldersgate Group members including Anglian Water, BT, Johnson Matthey, Legal and General Investment Management, National Grid, Scottish Power, Tesco, TLT LLP, Triodos Bank and the RSPB [2]. It follows a recent letter sent by over 200 business leaders to the Prime Minister calling for an economic recovery aligned with the UK\u2019s climate and environmental goals [3] and recommends key policies to deliver these types of projects on the ground.<br />\nReacting to the publication of the briefing, Nick Molho, Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, said: \u201cThere has rarely been a time when the economic, social and environmental agendas have been so closely aligned. It is clear from the case studies in our briefing that incentivising low carbon and nature restoration projects as part of the UK\u2019s recovery plan could do much to tackle economic and social concerns around jobs, regional inequality, long-term competitiveness and resilience.\u201d<br />\nToday\u2019s policy briefing argues that an economic recovery focused on stimulating low carbon and nature restoration projects could deliver key benefits, including:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>addressing regional inequality and unemployment;<\/li>\n\t<li>strengthening the UK\u2019s economic competitiveness and productivity through investment in the sectors and technologies of the future;<\/li>\n\t<li>delivering critical public goods, including clean air, better health and improved resilience to future environmental shocks;<\/li>\n\t<li>building a more resilient financial system fit to withstand future climate shocks;<\/li>\n\t<li>delivering the Global Britain agenda by strengthening the UK government\u2019s influence ahead of the G7 and COP26 summits that it will be hosting in 2021 and enabling UK businesses to be competitive providers of low carbon goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Nick Molho added: \u201cPutting an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at the heart of the UK\u2019s economic recovery need not be overly reliant on public money. Targeted public investment will be important to support early stage innovation in areas such as hydrogen and carbon capture but a lot of the heavy lifting can be done through the introduction of clear public policy signals to attract private sector investment in areas such as energy efficiency, charging infrastructure and natural capital projects.\u201d<br />\nPeter Simpson, Chief Executive, Anglian Water, said: \u201cThe need for economic recovery from Covid-19 in the face of the ever more pressing climate emergency presents business leaders not just with an opportunity to create a fairer, more sustainable future, but a responsibility to do so. I believe we can recover from this pandemic in a way that brings&nbsp;economic, environmental and social prosperity. We stand ready to work with government and our communities on a resilient, low carbon future that leaves nobody behind.\u201d<br />\nAndy Wales, Chief Digital Impact and Sustainability Officer at BT, said: \u201cAs we emerge from the crisis caused by Covid-19, government, businesses and policymakers must put action on climate at the heart of their efforts to revive the economy. BT is stepping up on climate action by backing new green technologies through our Green Tech Innovation Platform and by investing in the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure. We want to encourage and help others to do the same - creating a more sustainable, resilient, low carbon economy.\u201d<br />\nMartin Casey, Director Public Affairs Europe at CEMEX, said: \u201cAligning the economic recovery package with the UK\u2019s net zero emissions goal presents great opportunities for CEMEX. Reducing emissions is not limited to our production process but to the whole life cycle of our products and we have committed globally to reach net zero concrete by 2050. We are committed to continue reducing our direct and indirect emissions in our processes, both through the maximization of the traditional CO2 reduction levers and through implementing Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and other carbon innovative technologies. Our aim is to enable the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings and climate resilient infrastructures. Setting a clear policy direction for restarting the economy will enable the private sector to play its part in the recovery in a way that advances our climate and environmental goals.\u201d<br />\nSteve Andrews, CEO at Earthwatch Europe, said: \u201cIt is heartening to see so many organisations calling on Government to ensure a fairer, greener recovery post-COVID-19. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re listening. If COVID-19 and lockdown has taught us anything, it is the need to take science seriously and for Government to focus now, with urgency, on threats that seem beyond the electoral cycle.\u201d<br />\nAndy Walker, Technical Marketing Director at Johnson Matthey, said: \u201cAs this policy briefing outlines, the government has a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d to accelerate the transition to a low carbon and environmentally resilient economy as it develops and implements its strategy to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. Since the Climate Change Act was passed, the UK has successfully demonstrated that economic growth can go hand in hand with emissions reductions, further supporting the widely held view that measures which cut greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate the economy can be extremely effective in supporting jobs and<br />\neconomic growth. This \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d approach has the additional benefit of putting the UK on track to deliver our 2050 net zero commitments, strengthening our leadership and influence at the upcoming COP26 and G7 summits, as well as generating lasting social, competitiveness and resilience benefits.\u201d<br />\nAlexander Burr, Global ESG Public Policy Analyst at Legal and General Investment Management, said: \u201cThe UK government is faced with a unique opportunity to show that we are not returning to \u2018business as usual\u2019 through a recovery package that accelerates green economic growth. Over recent weeks, businesses and investors have been pledging their willingness and support for this agenda. The government should build on this foundation, bringing forward mandatory climate reporting and broadening its reach. Investors like LGIM<br />\nneed greater transparency and comparability from companies on their climate-related risks and opportunities, to direct capital into \u2018green\u2019 projects at scale. As we have seen lately, there is such a thing as being too late \u2013 it is time to act now!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power said: \u201cThere is now a compelling case for accelerating investment in a cleaner, greener society to deliver positive outcomes for both the economy and the environment. Positive outcomes that will benefit all of us thanks to cleaner power, cleaner home heating and cleaner transport. We must make our recovery green \u2013 delivering the much-needed jobs and investment that will get people, businesses, towns and cities back on their feet while cleaning up the environment and decarbonising the<br />\neconomy. The government cannot let this moment pass the country by.\u201d<br />\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be at the forefront of developing green infrastructure projects that will do just that. For example, partnering with Scottish Government and Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks to support the shift to electric vehicles in a way that will ensure fair and equal access for all. Developments like this will be a real game-changer in moving us closer to net zero \u2013 as well as supporting the economy \u2013 and that\u2019s why the two can, and must, go hand in hand. Only by doing that can we all achieve a cleaner and&nbsp;greener future \u2013 a better future \u2013 quicker.\u201d<br />\nMaria Connolly, Head of Clean Energy &amp; Real Estate at TLT LLP, said: \u201cThe positive impact that the last few months has had on the environment means that as we\u2019re looking forward the question that\u2019s being asked is, could a green recovery bolster the economy and accelerate our drive towards net zero by emphasising sustainable business practices and modern green industry over more traditional carbon intensive sectors? An economic recovery which places an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at its core would, without a doubt, also refocus growth, policy development and funding. While the backing of the financial sector is need to achieve this vision, for many banks and funders clean energy assets are still viewed as a stable investment, and if you consider the upscale in clean energy generation \u2013 an estimated 90GW of wind energy, 80GW of solar power and 30GW of energy storage - that will be required to achieve net zero then this represents an exciting opportunity to drive economic growth by creating jobs and developing local supply chains based on clean energy.\u201d<br />\nBevis Watts, CEO of Triodos Bank UK, said: \u201cWe now have a window of opportunity, as we seek to overcome the challenges of the coronavirus crisis. A recovery should seek to increase resilience across all areas of society and focus on shaping a more inclusive and low-carbon economy. Triodos has always been a pioneer in sustainable finance \u2013 most recently we have been looking at linking the economic and societal benefits we take for granted from nature to real investment in its restoration. We need collaborative action to develop an economy linked to societal health and environmental limits and require a financial sector that proactively looks for solutions to achieve that. Simply a move to avoiding harm is not enough.\u201d<br />\nJulia Barrett, Chief Sustainability Officer at Willmott Dixon, said: \u201cWe welcome this briefing from the Aldersgate Group, and believe that putting an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at the heart of the recovery will ensure that the UK economy is more competitive in the long-term whilst being more resilient to future risks. We believe that by investing in a nationwide retrofit programme supported by clear policy signals, government could deliver rapid localised job creation, whilst addressing the social&nbsp; inequalities associated with fuel poverty and poor health associated with living in cold homes. This is an essential step on our journey to net zero emissions as 80% of the buildings that will exist in 2050 are<br />\nhere now.\u201d<br />\nDarren Moorcroft, CEO of the Woodland Trust, said: \u201cA resilient economy and society require a resilient environment. This welcome work by the Aldersgate Group shows how vital&nbsp;it is that we seize this moment and ensure that actions to reboot the economy set us firmly on the road to net zero and show world leading ambition when it comes to restoring our natural environment. Protecting, restoring and expanding native tree cover \u2013 with all the social, economic and environmental benefits that will bring - belongs at the heart of any \u2018green recovery\u2019 worthy of the name. The Woodland Trust has a powerful record of delivery and stands ready to play its part - working alongside business, government and our NGO partners to help transform our nation into a better place for people and wildlife.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>\u2014ENDS\u2014<br />\nNotes to Editor<\/strong><br />\nThe Aldersgate Group is an alliance of leaders from business, politics and civil society that drives action for a sustainable economy. Our members include some of the largest businesses in the UK with a collective global turnover of nearly £550bn, leading NGOs, professional institutes, public sector bodies, trade associations and politicians from across the political spectrum. Our mission is to trigger the change in policy required to address environmental challenges effectively and secure economic benefits for the UK in doing so.<br />\n[1] The Aldersgate Group launces a new policy briefing today, Seize the moment: building a thriving, inclusive and resilient economy in the aftermath of COVID-19. The report will be available here:&nbsp;https://www.aldersgategroup.org.uk/latest#low-carbon-projects-are-a-key-solution-to-jobs-inequality-and-resilience-concerns&nbsp;<br />\n[2] The briefing provides an overview of a wide range of case studies and projects from Anglian Water, BT, Johnson Matthey, National Grid, Scottish Power, the Teeside Collective, Tesco, TLT LLP, Triodos, Legal and General Investment Management and the RSPB. This briefing will soon be followed by in-depth economic analysis from the London School of Economics commissioned by the Aldersgate Group, setting out what should be the key pillars of the UK\u2019s economic recovery plan.<br />\n[3] On 1 June 2020, around 200 business leaders \u2013 including several Aldersgate Group business members - wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and called for an economic recovery plan aligned with the UK\u2019s net zero target and other environmental goals.

        "Summary": "CEMEX has completed a sizable investment into a new conveyor system at its quarry in Swinderby, Lincolnshire, which will make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emissions and fuel use at the site. This is the latest development from the global buildings materials supplier as it leads the way in sustainable operations in line with its Future in Action program.",

        "Body": "<p>Supplied by Canning Conveyor, Swinderby\u2019s new conveyor reaches one mile in length and will bring sand and gravel from the extraction site directly to the processing plant. Canning supplied and installed the new conveyor system, which included a 20-tonne hopper feeder, a number of field conveyors and a radial stockpiler.<br />\nAs we move into the next phase of extraction this will minimize the use of diesel-powered dumpers; saving a projected 300,000 litres of fuel per year, the equivalent of taking 172 cars off the road. There will also be decreased dust and noise at the quarry.<br />\nSteve Sheller, CEMEX\u2019s Head of Business Development for West Europe Materials, commented: \u201cSwinderby is a crucial site in our portfolio; it supports our customers in the Birmingham metro-market and wider Midlands area, and has a considerable reserve potential of more than 10 million tonnes.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are therefore investing heavily into the site to ensure it can meet demand for years to come, while also achieving the sustainability targets set as part of our Future in Action global strategy. By using a conveyor we can considerably cut CO2 emissions \u2013 we\u2019ve calculated a ~50% reduction in CO2 per tonne of aggregate, when comparing to the anticipated consumption to work the next phase of the quarry using mobile plant, alongside further efficiency and cost savings. Taking into account forecasted production figures this is a total CO2 saving of approximately 74%.\u201d<br />\nAdditionally, a new processing plant is being installed at Swinderby, which will nearly double the site\u2019s production capability. This investment is due to be completed early 2023 and together with the new conveyor system will futureproof the site and enable continued supply to the key Midlands market, while meeting increased customer demand. Further investment opportunities for the site are also being explored around renewable energy sources.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about CEMEX visit www.cemex.com&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

The strategy involved a challenging audit process and complete change of culture amongst our employees,\u201d commented Andy Spencer, Director of Sustainability and Energy. Once each site had been audited and the results analysed, the right bins and skips for the right waste to minimise landfill and maximise recycling were put in place. With the right facilities on each site, a campaign highlighting environmental and financial benefits for better waste management was implemented to engage employees. Andy concludes: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have achieved it without the commitment of everyone in CEMEX UK.&nbsp; They have really embraced the whole initiative.&nbsp; It is now everyday practice for them to recycle and divert waste from landfill. Before Recycle R8 we had 27% waste diverted away from landfill today it is 80%, with us moving towards our 100% target.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Combined with the existing ReadyBlock Zero dense block, this launch enables customers to meet the concrete block requirements for housing and commercial developments using solely CarbonNeutral® products. CEMEX remains the only UK supplier to offer a fully net zero concrete block option.<\/p>\n\n<p>This provides developers with the opportunity to dramatically decrease the carbon footprint of their construction projects. An average three-bedroom home uses 3,500 concrete blocks to build, which, when using traditional products, equates to a total emissions rate of 14,000 kg/CO2e. This is the equivalent of a person on a plane travelling 2.4 times round the earth. Using ReadyBlock Zero and ReadyBrick Zero products would reduce the CO2e by around 70% so would take this down to around 4,200 kg \u2013 a significant reduction in emissions, especially if used for multiple buildings in one development. The remaining or residual CO2e would then be offset.<\/p>\n\n<p>ReadyBlock Zero Light and ReadyBrick Zero Common Brick are zero carbon concrete products which look identical to traditional concrete blocks and bricks, with the only difference being that they embody up to 80% less carbon, with the remaining carbon offset to make a CarbonNeutral product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. To do this CEMEX is working with Natural Capital Partners, an award-winning expert on carbon neutrality and climate finance, that is harnessing the power of business to create a more sustainable world.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ReadyBlock Zero range is part of CEMEX\u2019s VERTUA family of low carbon and sustainable Urbanisation Solutions and is available for projects across the UK, ahead of the Government\u2019s Future Homes Standard \u2013 when all new homes must produce 75-80% less carbon emissions by 2025.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Carl Platt, Urbanisation Solutions Director of Asphalt, Paving and Building Products for Europe, commented: \u201cThe initial launch of our ReadyBlock Zero dense concrete block was very well received, with customers asking us to expand our range further to include lightweight and common brick options. I\u2019m proud of the way we have quickly responded to feedback and now offer these two additional products nationwide. Together, they can present significant savings on emissions \u2013 imagine how much of a difference could be made to the carbon footprint of the construction industry if the ReadyBlock Zero and ReadyBrick Zero products were used for every new home built!\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s Climate Action strategy aims to lead the way in the construction industry and has an overall global ambition of delivering net zero carbon emissions in concrete by 2050.

        "Body": "<p>It presents the <strong><a href=\"/vertua-low-carbon-concrete\" target=\"\">Vertua® low carbon concrete range<\/a><\/strong>, which includes the option to offset residual CO2 and provide a CarbonNeutral product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua range is an important step to support the Company\u2019s recently announced climate strategy, which includes an ambition of delivering net zero concrete globally by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>The range features a variety of bespoke concrete mix designs and includes the Vertua ultra zero option, which is a CarbonNeutral product. This product achieves a 70% reduction in embodied carbon emissions, with the remaining unavoidable emissions offset through working with Natural Capital Partners, a carbon offset and carbon neutrality specialist.<\/p>\n\n<p>To contribute towards the 70% reduction, CEMEX is introducing a new innovative geopolymer cement solution, which was developed at its Global Research &amp; Development Centre in Switzerland and can be used in certain applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to Vertua ultra zero, the range also features other low carbon concretes which can be used in a wide range of applications and include an option for customers to choose the added benefit of offsetting the residual CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua line of low CO2 products was originally launched by CEMEX in France in July &nbsp;2018, and following its success, the offer has now been introduced to the UK and complemented by the offsetting option to deliver net zero carbon concrete. In line with our 2050 ambition, the range will be gradually extended to other geographies in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>After engineering carbon reductions into the concrete mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the concrete CarbonNeutral from cradle-to-customer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carbon offsetting is the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX will facilitate this by investing in projects which physically remove CO2 where possible from the atmosphere, such as planting more trees or protecting against deforestation through an independently audited and verified project. A CarbonNeutral certificate is then issued to the client.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is working with Natural Capital Partners, experts in carbon offset solutions, to assure the quality of the emissions reductions, which also deliver added benefits such as increasing biodiversity and reducing poverty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Michel Andre, VP Materials Western Europe for CEMEX, commented: \u201cConcrete is an essential part of construction \u2013 it is cost effective, versatile and typically made from local materials. Concrete is vital for the infrastructure that helps provide the UK with clean water, sanitation and energy, as well as durable homes, schools, hospitals, travel networks and much more.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cHowever, we recognise future construction needs to be balanced with the effect it is having on the environment. We at CEMEX know that we can best meet these challenges by working in partnership with our clients and stakeholders to develop solutions together. We continually invest and innovate to become an environmentally friendly, sustainable leader\u2014enabling a low-carbon and resource-efficient circular economy.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Spencer, VP Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX Europe, added: \u201cWe are really proud to introduce Vertua, the UK\u2019s first CarbonNeutral® ready mixed concrete product. By offering a range of low and \u2018zero\u2019 carbon concretes, including the ability to offset the current residual CO2, we aim to make it easy for clients to make the vital transition to more sustainable choices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe know that carbon offsetting is only an interim measure while we further develop technology that is still in early stages. At present we believe it is a good way to sequester the remaining CO2 from our lower carbon solutions to take important climate action now. We are sure this will prove a relevant solution as the construction sector looks to take rapid action to improve the sustainability and climate impacts of the built environment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Climate change has been a global priority for CEMEX for many years and has brought significant progress to date. But there is a need to do more and faster. This is why CEMEX has recently announced a more ambitious climate strategy, including a new global target for CO2 emissions by 2030: a reduction of 35% to ensure alignment with the Paris Agreement commitments. This is in addition to the ambition of delivering net zero concrete globally by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon in the Vertua range using a Carbon Footprint Calculator (CO2 Tool) that follows the principles of PAS2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua range of low carbon concretes will be formally launched in the UK at Futurebuild 2020 on CEMEX\u2019s stand (F70), held between 3rd \u2013 5th March at ExCeL London.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Interview opportunity<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX will be launching Vertua at the 2020 Futurebuild exhibition. There will be opportunities to interview Richard Kershaw, CEMEX Technical Manager, and Shane Hughes, CEMEX Carbon Manager, on Tuesday 3rd March.

        "Body": "<p>The traditional ceremony took place at the Damen Shipyards Galati in Romania, and was attended by representatives from both CEMEX and Damen.<br />\nMark Darren Williams, fleet engineering manager for CEMEX, commented at the ceremony: \u201cFor CEMEX UK Marine, its management and personnel, today is a milestone in our company history. This new ship represents a significant investment and the first new vessel both in the CEMEX fleet and that of the UK aggregate industry in over 20 years. Today we convert a lot of hard work, technical drawings, calculations, ideas, energetic discussions and exchange of point-of-views, into a physical floating object, by the highly skilled women and men of Galati and Mangalia.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe CEMEX Go Innovation is the first of Damen\u2019s new Marine Aggregate Dredger class, a 103.5 metre MAD 3500. The vessel is the result of close cooperation between CEMEX and Damen and represents the first of a new generation of efficient and economical dredgers specialising in the extraction of sand and gravel from the seabed. It is designed to extract aggregates from the sea bed up to depths of 55 metres, including in the challenging conditions experienced in the North Sea.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe CEMEX Go Innovation has been developed to offer major environmental savings while ensuring safety, high performance and sustainability. The result is a dredger which will have a 25% increased capacity, nearly double the dredging depth and discharge rate increase of 20%. Further design features include optimal balance between payload and efficiency, overall length of 103.5 metres, a deadweight of just under 7,000 tonnes and a maximum loaded speed of approximately 12 knots.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nFollowing its launch, the CEMEX Go Innovation will complete its fitting out with commissioning due to begin at the end of the year, and delivery expected in the early spring of 2020.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nLaurence Dagley, managing director, CEMEX Materials UK Southern, commented: \u201cIt was very exciting to see our state-of-the-art dredger, CEMEX Go Innovation, and participate in the traditional launch ceremony with Damen. This is a ground-breaking ship that leads the industry thanks to the major environmental savings that it offers, its increased capacity and dredging depth, and its safety-enhancing external pipework. We look forward to the CEMEX Go Innovation arriving in the UK and beginning its work early next year.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nKurt Cowdery, director of CEMEX Marine, added: \u201cCEMEX GO Innovation is a state-of-the-art vessel that will allow us to further enhance our Marine profile and capability in both the UK and Europe. &nbsp;We continue to stay ahead of our competitors and are maximising the opportunities available to us. We would like to thank all that have been involved with this project, in particular the Marine team. This is an excellent investment in our people, business and future!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n\u201cThe cooperation between Damen and CEMEX UK Marine has been really excellent,\u201d said Damen\u2019s Joppe Neijens, sales manager dredging for north, west and south Europe. \u201cIt has been a very smooth process and we have built the vessel together, using the original Damen MAD concept as the basis for a vessel optimised to meet the needs of CEMEX. They challenged us to meet their requirements and as a joint team we made it happen. This new dredger will differentiate itself from the current fleet and set a new standard in the industry. As such, the CEMEX Go Innovation represents the start of a new era. I can\u2019t wait to see the vessel sailing.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

Earlier this year CEMEX published its Green Financing Framework, which together with its Sustainability-Linked Framework align its corporate finance strategy to its sustainability commitments and support the financing of SDG-aligned investments in areas such as CO2 emissions reduction, clean electricity, energy efficiency, clean transportation, water management, air quality, circular economy, and waste management.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"x\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">In parallel to the UN\u2019s General Assembly, Business Fights Poverty held its Global Goals Summit where member companies shared their efforts in driving equity, building resilience, and fighting poverty.

Through an optimized concrete composition, a specific jobsite like a tunnel or bridge can achieve a CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;reduction of up to 13%, for a given level of strength.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cSpider Tracker is a true innovation for the building materials industry and another way we are providing a superior customer experience by putting new technology at their reach,\u201d said Fernando A. González, CEO of CEMEX. \u201cThis latest achievement is further proof of our commitment to sustainability and the success of our Digital Innovation in Motion program.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Spider Tracker\u2019s sensors are placed in fresh concrete to measure its temperature at various points during the setting process. That information is relayed to thermo-tracking cylinders built with the same concrete mix as the project and exposed to the same temperature through special containers. These cylinders recreate the hardening process at the same rate as the poured concrete, replicating resistance with more precision than other methods commonly available. By testing their resistance, builders may determine when their structure has reached its desired compressive strength.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other real-time monitoring technologies for concrete are based on a mathematical predictive formula. These traditional technologies may be off by up to 80% in their estimation of a structure\u2019s actual compressive strength. Spider Tracker has proven to be accurate by up to 95%, a game-changing innovation that gives the most accurate data available in the market.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To provide accurate information, Spider Tracker uses a thermographic camera to place the sensors in the coldest points of the structure. The technology also allows recording, controlling, and viewing of the entire process from a mobile application.<\/p>\n\n<p>Spider Tracker is specially made for large-scale projects such as bridges and multi-story buildings that require expensive pieces of formwork that need to be removed and reused. The technology has been shown to reduce construction times by as much as 40% in real-world tests. It has been used in the construction of the Science Building at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, Colombia. It is currently in the process of being scaled into new geographies.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is actively driving innovation in the construction industry by unlocking new value opportunities for its current and potential customers while boosting its internal innovation and efficiency. CEMEX\u2019s Digital Innovation in Motion program encompasses CEMEX\u2019s innovation efforts in its commercial offering, back-office processes, and smart manufacturing. The Spider Tracker technology is the result of work done by the company\u2019s global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by the CEMEX Research Center based in Switzerland. Spider Tracker\u2019s proprietary technology is patent pending.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Once used, stacked and stored, the scheme operator collects the pallets and returns deposits, before repairing pallets as necessary and recirculating them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Graeme Barton, National Sales Manager, Packed Cement, CEMEX added: \u201cAnnually, around 18 million pallets are estimated to be used in the UK construction sector, but only 10% are reused. The Pallet LOOP presents us with a solution that is better for business and better for the planet. We will have a far greater impact if we are all pulling in the same direction. We need the whole supply chain onside, because clearly the smallest change in process can have the biggest impact over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cAdditionally, The Pallet LOOP philosophy underpins CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action strategy, which focuses us on our critical 2050 decarbonisation targets by making changes that can be implemented right here and now, today. We are committed to working towards a circular economy and proud to be part of the collective that has signed The Pallet LOOP charter.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Paul Lewis, Founder of The Pallet LOOP, said: \u201cAs the only circular economy pallet supplier to the UK construction sector, our aim is to create a legacy of lasting change that accelerates the elimination of avoidable waste, repurposes pallets, and continuously improves safety.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo galvanise support for The Pallet LOOP, we created a charter for construction industry players to sign to make clear their commitment to considering a more sustainable solution for the movement of building materials. By signing The Pallet LOOP charter, our signatories have acknowledged, individually and collectively, that now is the time for change. Discussions are now moving forward apace across the industry and The Pallet LOOP is targeting early 2023 for the roll out of our green pallets throughout the building materials supply chain.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action programme is pioneering ways to increase the use of waste and residues as alternative raw materials and fuels.

In addition, the company expects significant demand in the Industrial & Commercial sector with onshoring and the redefinition of trade relationships due to supply chain constrains and geopolitical tensions. Mexico, Europe, and the US are particularly well-positioned to take advantage of the reshoring trends.

        "Body": "<p>\u201cIn the past three years, our business has proven its immense resilience in the face of a global pandemic, historic inflation, and supply chain disruptions,\u201d said CEMEX CEO Fernando González. \u201cI am incredibly proud of how we have navigated the extraordinary developments of the last few years. With the highest inflation in 40 years, we have been successful in recovering costs in dollar terms. In 2023, however, we must develop our pipeline of growth projects while we continue our efforts to recover margins as some cost headwinds, particularly in Europe, are still ahead of us. Our growth, climate action, and digital strategies, coupled with our Urbanization Solutions business will provide a strong base for growth over the medium term.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX has weathered inflation with a bold pricing initiative that has more than offset inflationary costs in dollar terms, but high inflation and supply chain headwinds have delayed its ability to regain margins. In the US, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes $110 billion dollars of incremental spending for highways and streets, the most cement-intensive portion of infrastructure. In Europe, the \u20ac750 billion from the Recovery Fund to invest in green technologies, clean energy and transportation, renovating buildings, and upgrading digital infrastructure, is expected to also be an important driver for building materials. In Mexico, the onshoring phenomenon is expected to drive demand for manufacturing and industrial construction in the medium-term.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX also announced at its CEMEX Day the goals of its new 2030 roadmap. The aggressive 2030 goals include a 47% reduction<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;in CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;per ton of cementitious material and a commitment to reach 65% consumption of clean electricity by 2030. Additionally, for the first time, CEMEX has set ambitious goals for Scope 3 emissions, showing CEMEX\u2019s commitment to decarbonize its entire value chain.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur products are essential for the wellbeing and development of humanity, and I am convinced that the transition to a net-zero industry is feasible,\u201d added Mr. González. \u201cMoreover, the journey to decarbonization can be profitable, as our customers reward those companies that are leaders in this global transition.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, CEMEX became one of the first companies in the cement industry to have its 2030 decarbonization targets verified by the Science Based Targets initiative for alignment with their 1.5°C scenario, the most ambitious scenario available to the industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vertua, the CEMEX\u2019s portfolio of sustainable and lower carbon products, is the linchpin of its contribution to decarbonizing the built environment and building a better, more sustainable, future for all. One of the most accepted lower carbon products in the industry, Vertua has seen strong adoption across CEMEX\u2019s markets. The company expects Vertua lower carbon products to account for the majority of its cement and concrete sales by 2025.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX launched its Future in Action program in March of 2021 to build a more sustainable, circular future, with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;company. Since then, the company has achieved record-breaking CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;reductions, and its performance to date has given the company the confidence that it can achieve a more accelerated pathway for 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX committed to the following 2030 goal vs. a 2020 baseline:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Reduction in scope 1 emissions of 31% per ton of cementitious material.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction in scope 2 emissions of 58% per ton of cementitious material.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of scope 3 emissions of 25% per ton of purchased clinker and cement.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of scope 3 emissions for 40% per ton of purchased fuels.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of 42% in absolute scope 3 emissions from the use of traded fuels.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of 30% of scope 3 emissions from upstream transportation and distribution per ton of materials transported.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><br />\nCEMEX (NYSE: CX) is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Currently, we know that intact ecosystems store more carbon safely and in the long term because they are more resilient. These days, global leaders are gathered at the COP25 Climate Summit in Madrid, engaged in very real discussions to address the effects of climate change and to fulfill the commitments we all set as signatories to the Paris Agreement. That is why this year\u2019s book is of such immediate importance, as it underscores the considerable potential of natural ecosystems to fight climate change,\u201d<\/em> said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nSince 1993, CEMEX has published a new book every year, blending extraordinary photography and informative content to guide its global audiences and reinforce its commitment to promoting a culture of biodiversity conservation. This year's volume is published in conjunction with Conservation International, Global Wildlife Conservation, Sea Legacy and, Wild Heritage.<br />\n\u201cWith the 27th edition of our Conservation Book Series, \u201cNature's Solutions to Climate Change,\u201d we alert our global audience to the urgent need to conserve, protect, and rehabilitate our natural ecosystems so they maximize their potential to store CO2. With global emissions still on the rise, this volume emphasizes the critical need to harness the full potential of natural solutions to mitigate climate change effectively,\u201d concluded Vicente Saiso, Corporate Director of Sustainability of CEMEX.<br />\nIn addition to raising public awareness through this series of books, CEMEX carries out different actions across its worldwide operations to combat climate change and promote the digital economy:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The reduction of emissions and the use of alternative fuels. Reducing net CO2 emissions per ton of cement by 21.6% and avoiding the generation of almost eight million tons of CO2 during 2018 compared with the company\u2019s 1990 baseline. We have a target to further reduce our emissions by 30% by 2030, in line with the science-base targets methodology for our sector.<\/li>\n\t<li>The restoration and conservation of biodiversity in its operations. Storing 23.5 million tons of CO2 naturally in its quarries, of which 96% had a current environmental rehabilitation plan in place at year-end 2018.<\/li>\n\t<li>The management and protection of El Carmen Nature Reserve. This extensive over 140,000-hectare wildlife preserve, equivalent to the size of Mexico City or Houston, Texas, captures around 11 million tons of CO2 naturally in its plant mass.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you want to know more about the latest edition of CEMEX Nature and Conservation&nbsp;Book Series, \u201cNature's Solutions to Climate Change,\u201d please visit the following link:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cemexnature.com/libro/natures-solutions-to-climate-change/\">http://www.cemexnature.com/libro/natures-solutions-to-climate-change/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Participants Information<br />\nConservation International uses science, policy, and partnerships to protect the nature that people rely on for food, fresh water, and livelihoods.

A local company took 74 furniture items and CEMEX staff took home 38 items for their home offices.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges involved the Rugby office\u2019s back-up diesel powered electric generator. It was connected directly to the mains electric supply for the offices and would automatically kick in should a power cut occur, this made its recovery challenging in terms of timing and safe disconnection. A big thanks to Peter Finney from our Rugby Cement plant for its safe disconnection following the relocation of our IT servers to Coventry, which gave us a tight window of opportunity before the building was handed over. The generator has been relocated within the Aggregates division just down the road from Rugby at Berkswell Quarry, replacing a currently hired unit. This provided an annual saving of over £12,000 and is a great example of working together as One CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>A big thanks to Natasha Page for coordinating the operations along with everyone else involved in organising these donations. In total, over 550 items were donated to new owners who will continue to get many more years of use from the items.<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>VIALOW Zero, supplied by CEMEX\u2019s Liverpool Docklands asphalt plant, was selected by the Council for Lark Lane, Liverpool. A vibrant hub of the city on the edge of the historic Sefton Park, Lark Lane is home to many popular local boutiques, bars and restaurants. With combined high-density pedestrian footfall and road user traffic, a continuous stream of round-the-clock access is required on Lark Lane, with businesses facing directly onto the busy street.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Working with Dowhigh Contractors, the use of warm asphalt (VIALOW) not only reduced CO2e, but also lowered the impact of construction fumes during the re-surfacing, creating a better environment for local residents, pedestrians, and Dowhigh\u2019s contractor workforce throughout the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Liverpool County Council were also able to reduce the total time needed for traffic restrictions and road closure, with VIALOW as the asphalt reaches the appropriate trafficking temperatures faster than conventional hot mix asphalt. The re-opening of Lark Lane was fast-tracked as a result, minimising the overall disruption to the immediate local community and busy road users, as well as car fumes from stationary queuing cars. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Alongside the reduced carbon in the mix, Liverpool County Council chose to offset the residual CO2e to make it a CarbonNeutral product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. &nbsp;By offsetting the residual CO2e from the 284 tonnes of asphalt used for the project, 16 tonnes of CO2e was offset; the equivalent of the emissions generated by the annual electricity use for 24 homes on Lark Lane for a year.&nbsp;<br />\nVIALOW is a range of low temperature, low carbon asphalts from CEMEX. A specially formulated bitumen additive is used to enable manufacture at up to 40°C lower than standard asphalt mixes with no compromise in performance, and the added benefit of achieving up to 20% reduction in embodied carbon emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Allan Jones, Head of Business and Strategy, Dowhigh commented: \u201cThe Lark Lane project was successfully completed with CEMEX, using VIALOW, which helped us save 16 tonnes of carbon. This project will hopefully be the beginning of a determined move to make our roads greener and more sustainable for the future.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Pete Hoare, CEMEX\u2019s Asphalt Area Manager, added: \u201cWe want to make it easier for local authorities and councils to specify lower carbon solutions. As a result, we worked closely with Liverpool County Council to provide a hardworking solution that not only reduced CO2e, but also the impact on the local community environment as well.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cStationary vehicles at traffic lights on road closures can create 4 times as many pollutants, when compared to moving vehicles, so it\u2019s really important that we help to minimise traffic restrictions and the resulting car fumes, whilst roads are being maintained and repaired. Vialow is the optimum asphalt solution to increase overall productivity in restricted areas, whilst significantly saving CO2e to drive forward the government\u2019s low-carbon economy by 2050.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>VIALOW belongs to the Vertua® family of sustainable building materials now offered by CEMEX as part of its commitment to enhancing the environmental credentials of its operations.

        "Body": "<p>Regenera leverages CEMEX\u2019s substantial international footprint and the ability of its production processes to use non-recyclable waste and industrial by-products as more sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels and natural raw materials.<br />\nRegenera is actively working on several major projects across the EMEA region:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>In France, Regenera operates a multiservice dock located in an industrial harbor in Paris offering a wide range of circular economy services to the construction industry. The company receives a variety of materials, including construction debris, excavated material and inert soil, which it sorts, processes, and transforms into recycled aggregates or inert material used to restore quarries.<\/li>\n\t<li>In Egypt, Regenera has signed a three-year agreement with the NGO Very Nile to support waste removal efforts from the Nile River. The recovered non-recyclable materials will be used to substitute fossil fuels at CEMEX\u2019s Assiut cement plant, with other materials being recycled or upcycled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Additional projects are also underway in CEMEX\u2019s wider global business. In Mexico, Regenera is already processing almost two million tons of waste streams per year, and is now working with the government of Mexico City on its \u201cZero Waste Plan\u201d. Meanwhile, in Colombia, Regenera has signed an agreement to work with Tetrapak, to receive and separate multilayer cartons at its facility and return those that can be reused or recycled.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Regenera aims to serve a diverse client base which includes industrial, manufacturing, construction and waste collection companies, NGOs, and governments. Regenera provides sustainable solutions for three major waste streams: municipal and industrial, construction, demolition, and excavation (CDEW), and industrial byproducts.&nbsp;<br />\nSergio Menendez, Regional President for CEMEX EMEA, commented: \u201cGrowing a circular economy is a key pillar of our dedicated climate action strategy, Future in Action, as it not only reduces waste being sent to landfill, but also helps to preserve natural resources and reduce emissions. The launch of Regenera is therefore the latest step in our efforts to be a net-zero CO2 company globally by 2050.<br />\n\u201cWe believe that CEMEX and other companies in the building materials industry can be a major contributor to a more circular society, and our role in utilising waste and byproducts is key to a greener economy.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s Future in Action programme is pioneering ways to increase the use of waste and residues as alternative raw materials and fuels.

        "Body": "<p>Over 600 individual concrete crossing bearers ranging from lengths of 2.5 metres up to 10.3 metres were needed to replace the existing \u201cscissor switch diamond\u201d junction just outside the station.&nbsp;<br />\nBecause of the complexity of the design, split bearers were not suitable, meaning single bearers of a considerably longer length than is usually manufactured were required. A specialist mix had to be implemented to ensure the high standards needed were met. The team also reconfigured the production plant at CEMEX\u2019s specialist bearer facility based in Somercotes, Derbyshire, to fulfil the order while still meeting the business\u2019s requirements for safe and sustainable mobility.&nbsp;<br />\nAlongside the longer length bearers, the project included split modular bearers with both full size and reduced shear plates, many third rail positions were required on specific bearers, under bearer pads throughout the layout and strap rail positions.<br />\nIn total, CEMEX provided 2185 linear metres of concrete for the project, accompanying 700 metres of new rail, 6000 tons of ballast and 1000 metres of conductor rail from Network Rail\u2019s supply chain.&nbsp;<br />\nThis was a sizable replacement and was in the planning for over a period of two years, with CEMEX working closely with Network Rail and the Switch and Crossing manufacturer Progress Rail Services UK, throughout. Installation took place over a nine-day period, with further challenges presented due to a nearby bridge.&nbsp;<br />\nTerence Clair, S&amp;C Business Manager for CEMEX UK Rail Solutions, commented: \u201cThis was a multifaceted project that required an innovative solution to ensure the customer\u2019s requirements were met safely and sustainably. Production of bearers of this size had never been done before but thanks to the dedication of our team we were able to rise to the challenge!&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe new junction looks fantastic and replacing the existing timber bearers with our resilient and hard-wearing concrete products will ensure longevity for many years to come. Our bearers are safety critical to the UK rail infrastructure and are the foundations that allow the country\u2019s trains to run safely.

While we are progressing important carbon capture projects and policy advocacy for our ultimate net zero target, these 2030 interim aspirations are not reliant on this technology.\u201d<br />\n\u201cThis is certainly a challenging target, but I am confident that with innovative thinking, close collaboration between our different business areas, and further development of our regulatory framework, it is both feasible and profitable. This sustained effort is vital if we are to meet our global, primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050. We will continue to provide regular updates on our progress.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s European cement operations were able to achieve the substantial CO2 emission reduction in 2022 thanks to significant developments in its climate action activity, including a large investment in a new alternative fuels facility in the UK, investment into solar energy at sites in countries including Germany and Poland, plus increasing supply of its more sustainable Vertua products across the region.<br />\nThe business\u2019s European cement plants have worked hard to reduce emissions, with CEMEX Spain signing an important agreement to ensure 30% renewable energy supply for its cement plants, while the region has also seen a reduction in clinker factor along with an increase in the use of alternative raw materials that lower the carbon footprint of the process.<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s global Future in Action strategy recognises that the opportunity for reducing emissions is not limited to the production process but to the entire life cycle of its products, as well as transforming the industry\u2019s value chain.

This was an issue as CEMEX is not the landowner and access is required to the wharf edge by Stevedores, ship\u2019s crew and ABP staff.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Nigel explains: \u201cI remembered a visit I had to Concrete Products at Wick as part of my role and business familiarisation back over 19 years ago, when I had a tour of Wick Products with Sue Townsend. I was aware of multiple sites in Readymix and Aggregates that had previously sourced \u2018lego blocks\u2019 externally at a significant cost and used them for demarcating areas. I remembered from my visit to Wick they used to have waste concrete moulds. I spoke to Sue who willingly agreed to start producing the Jersey blocks for us at Swansea.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The blocks were delivered and put in place by a local haulage contractor, FG Bond, who Wick Products used. By reaching out across different business areas within CEMEX, and with full support form Sue, we only had to pay for delivery and placement costs. This offered us a great solution to the problem at a very low-cost using waste concrete.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The benefits mean the movable edge protection will allow safe access for Stevedores and port staff without fixed structures requiring permission of third-party site owner. They can be handled by forklift or telehandler for placement around site, and for ease of movement during cleaning/housekeeping.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">We have since discussed another batch to be delivered to our CEMEX Cardiff Wharf for similar uses and with other boundary demarcating purposes.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Well done Nigel \u2013 a fantastic initiative which will help towards achieving our Zero 4 Life goal.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>"

The goal is also to develop digital tools i.e., BIM to track materials, manage CDW (Construction and Demolition Waste) and reduce CO2. &nbsp; PLGBC, the Polish Green Building Association, is also a partner in Poland.<br />\nToday, construction and demolition waste (CDW) accounts for up to 30% of all waste generated in the European Union. Although more than 75% is recycled, there is still a lot of valuable material ending up in landfill. In the long term, the innovations developed in the project are estimated to reduce construction waste by 80% and reduce the CO2 footprint by 70% in the construction sector.<br />\nThe Reincarnate project will develop the Reincarnate Circular Potential Information Model (CP-IM) platform. The data collected in the CP-IM will then serve as a source of technological innovation in areas such as building control and inspection, construction and dismantling planning, and CSD identification and classification.&nbsp;<br />\nThe Reincarnate project will focus in particular on developing the required social innovations that will allow for the widespread application of circular concepts. The social innovations to be developed will be at the intersection of social-behavioural and economic solutions.<br />\n\u201cWe are very proud to see our operation in Poland join the Reincarnate project alongside businesses from across the world. We believe that collaborating with innovative businesses and industries is vital if we are to achieve our goal of operating as a net-zero organisation by 2050. We are excited to see what is developed as part of this partnership, and the positive impact it will have on the more sustainable construction solutions available to our customers,\u201d commented Ruediger Kuhn, VP Materials Central Europe CEMEX.<br />\n\u201cCEMEX Poland actively supports all initiatives whose goals are consistent with our global climate strategy \"Future in Action.\" An example of such an initiative is the ambitious \"Reincarnate\" project, under which we intend to develop, among other things, concrete products with a low carbon footprint and the possibility of using recycled aggregates. We plan as well as digitising our processes and the information we provide, i.e., creating a materials database for the BIM model and digital delivery documents for our products. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are pleased that through our involvement in this venture we can share good practices and ideas with both Polish and foreign partners, as well as learn from their knowledge and experience. We are convinced that our cooperation will result in many innovations that will benefit the European industry in the future,\" says Michał Grys, Director of the Materials Division, Member of the Management Board at CEMEX Poland.&nbsp;<br />\nThe \"Reincarnate\" project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101056773.<br />\nThe project is scheduled for completion in May 2026.<br />\nMore information about the project: <a href=\"https://www.reincarnate-project.eu/\">https://www.reincarnate-project.eu/<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX is a global building materials company that cares about a better future for future generations through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>The Vertua brand now covers five sustainability attributes: lower carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency, saving water, incorporating recycled materials and optimising design. These attributes have been identified in line with Cemex\u2019s dedicated climate action strategy, Future in Action, which targets operation as a net-zero company globally by 2050.<br />\nAny products to bear the Vertua brand must meet strict criteria for at least one of these sustainable attributes, with the benefits clearly and transparently presented for customers on a fact label. These new labels also fulfil the function of promoting the most technical part of each attribute and will be applied on assets including packaging, websites and brochures.<br />\nThe launch of this updated brand portfolio has now begun in Cemex\u2019s European business. It starts in France this week, where the company is appearing at the Low Carbon World exhibition in Paris on the 5th and 6th April. Deployment will continue across the region, with all countries anticipated to have integrated the new brand into its operation by June.&nbsp;<br />\nSergio Menendez, President of Cemex EMEA, commented: \u201cCemex is attuned to the need to focus on all aspects that can make a product more sustainable; not just achieving a lower carbon footprint. With the updated classification system for Vertua, customers can now more easily identify which of our products leverage the cutting-edge technology and innovation that will enable them to overcome the challenges they are currently facing in construction and renovation, such as thermal regulation of buildings, soil permeability and conservation of natural resources.<br />\n\u201cThe enhanced Vertua brand represents a more ambitious and stronger approach: from a group of low carbon products to a family of products and solutions that encompass more sustainable attributes and contribute to our company vision of building a better future.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\nThis extension to the Vertua brand is the latest development from Cemex, which continues to act as pioneers in more sustainable solutions for its customers. It comes shortly after the business announced a milestone 41 per cent reduction* in the CO2 emissions generated by its European cement business in 2022. Cemex expects to exceed its 2030 aspiration of hitting a 55% CO2 reduction in its European operations.<br />\nVertua's goal is to be positioned as a brand that offers a comprehensive and crucial range of environmental attributes; from lower energy to use of recycled materials; expanding its field of action and strengthening its sustainability credentials.&nbsp;<br />\nFor more information, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/future-in-action\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/future-in-action<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>* Compared to 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nCemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Cemex in Germany has already converted eight of its 14 ready-mix concrete plants in the Berlin-Brandenburg region to offer concrete with recycled aggregates: the sites in Spandau, Hohenschönhausen, Kreuzberg, Bernau, Finowfurt, Velten, Schönefeld and Grünheide are technically capable of producing and supplying concrete with recycled aggregates. The experts of Cemex are pleased to advise interested parties on the application possibilities and explain the technical details.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concrete with recycled aggregates contains aggregates from professionally processed mineral construction waste, essentially concrete fragments that have been brought to the required particle sizes in crushers and impact mills - concrete is a material that can be recycled again and again. Concretes with recycled aggregates are subject to the same requirements as conventional ready-mix concretes and show identical fresh and hardened concrete properties.<\/p>\n\n<p>By expanding its offer with concretes with recycled aggregates, the building materials company is adapting its product mix to customer needs and strengthening the circular economy: with their recycled constituents, concrete with recycled aggregates contributes actively to the conservation of natural resources.<\/p>\n\n<p>The concretes with recycled aggregates for the Berlin metropolitan market are part of the Vertua® product family, Cemex's global brand for products with sustainable attributes, comprising ready-mix concretes, cements, aggregates, and admixtures. Furthermore, Cemex launched in early 2023 Regenera, a brand that provides circularity solutions. Regenera offers a wide range of tailored services, including reception, management, recycling, and coprocessing of waste.<\/p>\n\n<p>All local activities are part of Cemex's global sustainability and decarbonization strategy \u201cFuture in Action\u201d. One of the six pillars of Future in Action is circular economy. The strategy aims to decisively reduce not only emissions from the production process, but also emissions along the entire product life cycle and value chain with the objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex<\/strong><br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions. Cemex is committed to achieving carbon neutrality through relentless innovation and industry-leading research and development. Cemex is at the forefront of the circular economy in the construction value chain and is pioneering ways to increase the use of waste and residues as alternative raw materials and fuels in its operations with the use of new technologies.&nbsp;<br />\nCemex offers cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and urbanisation solutions in growing markets around the world, powered by a multinational workforce focused on providing a superior customer experience, enabled by digital technologies.

        "Summary": "Cemex has made a considerable investment into its UK rail network, making improvements at several of its depots across the country. These developments support Cemex\u2019s efforts to increase the use of rail to move its materials, as part of its Future in Action sustainability strategy.",

        "Body": "<p>Work was carried out at Cemex\u2019s Dove Holes, Selby and Bletchley depots, with a particular focus on improving health &amp; safety and efficiency through track and walkway upgrades. This work was all completed in partnership with MLP Railway Maintenance Ltd, Cemex\u2019s chosen provider for these developments.<br />\nAt Selby in North Yorkshire, upgraded track means the site can take an increased number of wagons per train, and complete turnarounds more efficiently and safely. Meanwhile, at Dove Holes in Buxton, two reception lines were relayed. This was a significant project which required considerable planning and coordination with Network Rail, as the site runs adjacent to the main line. &nbsp;<br />\nFinally, the team collaborated with Network Rail again at Bletchley in Milton Keynes, to implement improved walkways, CCTV and a waterproof display screen for offloading. This allows ground staff to watch the process from outside of the discharge area, reducing noise and dust exposure. &nbsp;<br />\nThese three development activities were supported by smaller walkway improvements made at other Cemex rail depots, including Crawley and Stourton. The walkway improvements were completed in collaboration with Network Rail\u2019s Freight Safety Improvement Portfolio and helped to improve the walkways adjacent to Cemex\u2019s that Network Rail is responsible for. Cemex works to an established industry track and walking route standard to ensure a safe and reliable operation for its employees and contractors, while reducing the risk of derailments. &nbsp;<br />\nMark Grimshaw-Smith, Rail and Sea Manager, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to invest in our rail heads across the UK. This not only ensures that the safety and wellbeing of those who work on our sites is enhanced on an ongoing basis, but it also provides further resilience in the operation, transporting more materials by train and thus taking more trucks off the road.<br />\n\u201cClose collaboration with Network Rail was vital during this project as we worked alongside the mainline, and we are grateful to them and our own local teams for their support. We also ensured minimal impact to customers thanks to a robust supply chain management process.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nFor more information, visit: www.cemex.co.uk&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex:<\/strong><br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>A specialist team from Cemex Rugby visited three local primary schools with one of the brand\u2019s 44-tonne cement tankers. The team provided an insight and education on the blind spots and hazards presented by HGVs, with 150 pupils engaged in the activities.<br />\nAt each school, the children enjoyed an interactive classroom presentation and colouring activity, before being shown around the vehicle and introduced to various safety features, such as the pedestrian \u2018Side Scan\u2019.&nbsp;<br />\nTo further support their understanding of the risks HGVs present to vulnerable road users such as themselves, a visual demonstration of the blind spot from the driver\u2019s seat took place. The children were asked to line up facing away from the truck with a teacher sat in the driver\u2019s seat. They then attempted to count how many children the teacher could see. Coloured discs were then laid out to visualise this, with the children were encouraged to share photos of the demonstration with their parents.<br />\nFinally, the children were given the opportunity to sit in the driver\u2019s seat for a driver\u2019s-eye view, which was a popular activity! All children were all given child-sized high visibility vests, reflective slap bands, and a fun educational road safety leaflet as mementos of the occasion.<br />\nDarrell Collins, Driver Trainer and Assessor for Cemex UK, commented: \u201cCemex was very proud to have this opportunity to provide vital road safety education to children in our local community. Working with vulnerable road users such as children to ensure they better understand the risks associated with HGVs is something we are passionate about and an integral part of our health and safety strategy. Incorporating hands-on activities that enable the children to see from the driver\u2019s perspective are hugely valuable and make a real difference to how they act around trucks when they come across them in real life. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe success of these events has prompted us to continue this awareness-raising with more schools in the area, with further outreach sessions in the pipeline.\u201d<br />\nFor more information about Cemex\u2019s pedestrian safety activities, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/pedestrian-safety\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/pedestrian-safety<\/a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Cemex\u2019s VIALOW, VIAFLOW®, and VIACOURT® asphalt, plus newer products that use a lower carbon bitumen, now form a new series of high-performance asphalt solutions which have been stringently classified to join the Vertua® product family, as part of Cemex\u2019s Vertua® brand expansion programme.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>All Cemex products which carry the Vertua® brand must meet strict criteria for at least one of five sustainable attributes ranging from lower carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency, water conservation, through to incorporating recycled materials and design optimisation. These attributes have been identified in line with Cemex\u2019s dedicated Future in Action climate action strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>VIALOW is a low temperature, reduced carbon asphalt which comes with the option to offset residual CO2 to make it a CarbonNeutral® product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. VIALOW\u2019s specially formulated bitumen additive enables manufacture at up to 40°C lower than standard asphalt mixes with no compromise in performance, and the added benefit of achieving up to 20% reduction in embodied carbon emissions. Cemex\u2019s lower temperature asphalt solutions are enabled by the company\u2019s technically advanced admixtures capabilities, a further differentiating lever that enables Cemex to continue leading the path in developing innovative, more sustainable solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s latest lower carbon asphalt innovation, features a new bio-component binder which locks carbon into asphalt. This reduces the carbon footprint of the bitumen by up to 250 kg of CO2e when compared with conventional bitumen, which in turn reduces the CO2e in the asphalt by as much as a third. The solution involves the addition of biogenic components engineered to ensure bitumen compatibility that won\u2019t compromise the performance characteristics of asphalt. The end-result is an asphalt that can be recycled whilst also retaining captured bio-carbon in the long term.<\/p>\n\n<p>VIAFLOW® is a range of permeable asphalt mixes with a highly durable, free draining surface, which allows water to pass through to the underlying structure or drainage system. Rated highly for its water management properties, VIAFLOW® is suitable for use as part of a designed Sustainable drainage system (SUDS), either through distribution to ground/drainage or for use in 'greywater harvesting' applications. VIAFLOW properties can be further enhanced when forming a system with Cemex\u2019s Permaflow permeable concrete, ensuring an optimal solution for surface and storm water management.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>VIACOURT® is an optimum asphalt material designed and engineered for use in high performance sports surfaces. Designed to provide a rapid draining surface for tennis courts and other sports surfaces, VIACOURT® allows sport to recommence soon after periods of rain fall.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Scott Jones, Director of Asphalt and Paving Solutions for Cemex EMEA, comments: \u201cOur comprehensive range of Vertua® asphalt solutions allow customers to measure the sustainable impact of their projects because the attributes are now verifiable. This can be reflected both in the product manufacturing process and in the useful life of the project. Vertua®\u2019s single-minded ambition is to extend its value to all products in Cemex\u2019s portfolio, leveraging cutting-edge technology and pioneering innovation to help clients meet their construction needs more sustainably.\u2019\u2019<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nVertua® asphalt solutions are integral high-performance products offered by Cemex\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions Europe business. Capabilities also include a range of next generation of admixtures to enhance product attributes such as strength, workability, and water demand, contributing to a reduced carbon footprint.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The complete Vertua® product portfolio forms a central part of Cemex\u2019s broader Future in Action strategy to be a net zero CO2 company by 2050, providing customers and partners with efficient solutions to meet environmental goals and lead the way for responsible construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/asphalt-range\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/asphalt-range<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Following a series of lab and plant trials, the trial has been designed to test the concrete\u2019s durability and longevity in a true to life airport setting.<br />\nInitially two lower carbon solutions will be tested: a Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) equivalent mix containing 50% GGBS, and a zero-clinker product. The lower carbon concrete will be trialled at the airport in a pouring site under the watch tower as part of a phased process to test its strength and durability in the field. The project, led by Jacobs and implemented by Cemex and Ecocem will see the lower carbon concrete assessed for use in main airport areas, groundworks and auxiliary purposes.<br />\nWith aircraft taking off and landing every 45 seconds pre-pandemic, it is critical the concrete undergoes rigorous testing to ensure its strength and durability can withstand the pressures of the one of the world\u2019s busiest airports. The aim is for the trial\u2019s findings to be used to set out a blueprint that other airports, keen to reduce carbon from all facets of their operation, can follow.<br />\nRichard Kershaw, Technical Manager at Cemex said: \u201cCemex is renowned across the construction industry for its commitment to providing customers with more sustainable concrete solutions. We were the first supplier in the UK to launch a net-zero concrete product, making us ideally situated to support Heathrow with their lower carbon concrete trial. We hope this trial will prove successful and demonstrate to the aviation sector the opportunities available to cut emissions during their development projects.\u201d<br />\nNigel Milton, Chief of Staff and Carbon at Heathrow said: \u201cHeathrow is once again serving as a testbed for ground-breaking technologies, demonstrating global leadership with regards to sustainable travel. We\u2019re committed to cutting carbon emissions on the ground as well as in the air and we\u2019re delighted to be hosting one of the first airport trials in the world to test lower carbon alternatives. I hope that this trial will help radically transform the built environment at Heathrow in the years to come.\u201d<br />\nMark Till, UK National Sales Manager at Ecocem, said: \u201cOur technical solutions have long helped large scale infrastructure projects to reduce carbon emissions across Europe. Having the opportunity to partner with Heathrow airport on a project with huge potential in the UK and for the aviation sector is a testament to the innovation of our products and team. We look forward to working with Heathrow and our other partners to begin this trial.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\nRichard Moore, Europe Aviation Engineering Lead at Jacobs said: \u201cJacobs are delighted to have been the technical consultant on the Low Carbon Concrete initiative at Heathrow since its inception in 2018. The trial is an exciting milestone in the development of lower carbon infrastructure solutions at the airport. It is the culmination of four years of research and planning towards these initial trials which will form the foundation of further work exploring other lower carbon products and materials. Testing the materials in a range of airport infrastructure applications, not just runway and taxiway pavements, allows us to maximise the opportunity to reduce embedded carbon in a wide variety of concrete types. Building on the success of the trial, we look forward to upscaling to usage in airfield projects being delivered by Ferrovial Construction, Dyer and Butler and other major programme partners across the airport.\u201d &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nThis trial at Heathrow Airport is the latest example of Cemex\u2019s commitment to fostering partnerships with forward-thinking organisations as part of its efforts to achieve true carbon neutrality, in line with the Future in Action program.<br />\nFor more information, visit: www.cemex.co.uk &nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Funded by both Liverpool City Council and British Cycling, an underused part of Everton Park has been transformed into Liverpool\u2019s first purpose-built children\u2019s learn-to-ride facility. The £380,000 \u201cMini-Roads\u201d scheme was delivered by highways contractor Dowhigh Ltd, working in close partnership with Cemex and Shell Construction and Road to realise the partnership\u2019s first successful largescale application trial of Shell\u2019s Bitumen CarbonSink, a new bio-component binder which locks carbon into asphalt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Shell Bitumen CarbonSink reduces carbon footprint by up to 250kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of bitumen. The solution involves the addition of biogenic components engineered to ensure bitumen compatibility that won\u2019t compromise the performance characteristics of asphalt. The end result is an asphalt pavement that can be recycled whilst also retaining captured bio-carbon in the long term.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As well as reclaiming and recycling existing materials onsite to re-use in the new road construction, Cemex\u2019s Rubbermix asphalt was supplied. Rubbermix transforms used tyres into new valuable roads, helping to offset the environmental impact of highway maintenance activity through the circular economy. With one tyre per tonne of asphalt, Rubbermix offers the potential to recycle up to 500 tyres per kilometre of road, depending on layer thickness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scott Jones, Director Asphalt and Paving Solutions EMEA, Cemex, comments: \u201cEverton Park\u2019s new cycle track surface features a ground-breaking technical carbon sink, creating a hard wearing asphalt road surface for thousands of future road users to enjoy for many years to come. &nbsp;With no compromise on quality or longevity, the new asphalt road is recyclable, and most of this carbon will not re-enter the atmosphere, even at the end of its life. Cemex is particularly keen to proactively support projects promoting sustainable urban mobility and is committed to reducing environmental impact by lowering the carbon footprint and increasing circularity \u2013 Everton Park has provided the perfect opportunity to showcase our expertise in this field.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Nikhil Subedi, Environmental Sustainability Officer, Dowhigh comments: \u201cEverton Park is a modern park on an historic site with an important community legacy. The Everton Park P2R Mini Road is an example of how we can tackle the issue of carbon emission in road construction. We want to make it easier for local authorities and councils to regenerate and maintain urban spaces like these with lower carbon solutions. Technical innovation to accelerate the decarbonisation of the construction and road sector is critical \u2013 working with Cemex and Shell\u2019s Bitumen CarbonSink has enabled us to deliver on our mission to maintain the quality and integrity of our roads and highways, whilst driving the circular economy to lower CO2e, reduce waste and create cleaner, more sustainable environments.\u201c &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The half kilometre long Mini Roads track has been expertly designed to imitate a realistic road lay out, with junctions and crossings. As well as new surface works, the new facility includes new asphalt and soft-play surfacing to provide an all-year round community asset.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mini Roads was recently officially opened to the public and the community and key stakeholders came together to celebrate the launch. The not-for-profit community organisation Peloton Liverpool, instrumental in the concept and realisation of the project, will be launching a programme of cycle sessions at the facility over the next five years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Asphalt containing Shell Bitumen CarbonSink will be offered to future customers as part of Cemex\u2019s Vertua family of products and solutions. The Vertua lower carbon product symbol is awarded to selected Cemex products characterised by their unique raw material composition, which contains the highest quality ingredients to reduce the carbon footprint of the finished product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex aims to be the partner of choice in sustainable urbanisation and indeed this asphalt supply is the latest example of Cemex providing Liverpool City Council with more sustainable solutions, following on from the road re-surfacing programme at Lark Lane last year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s Climate Action strategy \u2018Future in Action\u2019 aims to lead the way in the construction industry with an overall global ambition of delivering net zero carbon emissions by 2050. One of the key Future in Action pillars is precisely aimed at partnering with leaders in their respective fields, such as Liverpool City Council and Shell, to lead the path in the sustainability journey of the built environment.

During vehicle operation itself, the 315 kW e-motor produces no carbon emissions, either when driving to or working on the construction site, which can help urban air quality. The noise level is also significantly reduced by the electric drive; the almost silent driving operation offers advantages especially where strict noise protection regulations apply, such as in conurbations. The payload is the same as that of a conventional truck mixer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks to innovative technology, the battery capacity of the iONTRON eMixer is 350 kWh: One battery charge is sufficient for a full workday of around eight hours with five to six tours in inner-city traffic. For more trips, the eMixer can be easily charged in between thanks to a standard CCS/Combo 2 plug. It recovers its full battery capacity overnight at a DC charging station in the ready-mix concrete plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project is part of Cemex\u2019s Future in Action program, which focuses on achieving sustainable excellence through climate action, circularity, and natural resource management with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO\u2082 company by 2050.<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>BPD is ideal for use on farmland due to its high potassium and lime content meaning it can provide a direct sustainable replacement for traditional fertilisers and lime.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, by re-using BPD, Cemex has been able to dramatically reduce the amount of process by-product it landfills; this figure is now zero.&nbsp;<br />\nContributing to the circular economy is a key pillar of Cemex\u2019s climate action strategy Future in Action, which has set a global target to become a net zero company by 2050. In addition, recovering BPD supports Cemex\u2019s 2030 target to increase the ratio of waste derived sources managed versus waste sent for disposal.<br />\nPaul Fletcher, Head of Sustainability for Cemex Europe, commented: \u201cWe are very proud of our partnership with Silverwoods and the considerable positive impact their innovation and expertise has had on our ability to reuse BPD for other applications. We believe it leads the way in our industry and presents real potential to be adapted elsewhere across our operation; not only does it benefit the environment by reducing the amount of materials that need to be disposed of, but it generates a product that has a value for farmers and helps cut the use of traditional materials.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cIndeed, the value of this partnership demonstrates that to deliver true circularity, more industrial by-products, including those from different sectors of the economy, need to be used as secondary resources, rather than primarily be seen as waste. If this is to be achieved, a new perspective is needed to boost circular economy practices, with regulations and permitting supporting this proactively.\u201d<br />\nTo further explore the benefits of using Cemex\u2019s BPD in an agricultural setting, Silverwoods has funded two Research and Development PhD studies. The first identified the agronomic benefits of the land application of By-Pass Dust (BPD) while the second, which is currently ongoing, attempts to calculate how much carbon can be captured and sequestered from the land application of BPD through Enhanced Rock Weathering and also via improved crop performance.<br />\nThis research was recently recognised at the Eco Innovation North West Awards at the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester organized by Lancaster University, winning the Carbon Journey Award.<br />\nJulian Silverwood, Managing Director, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to win this recognition from Eco-I North West. Our work with Lancaster University has been a huge success in helping us understand the full carbon sequestration potential of cement bypass dust when applied to agricultural soils. It has validated that there is huge potential for the use of industrial waste to establish negative emission solutions, which is good for the environment and contributes to the UK\u2019s aim to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\u201d<br />\nFor more information, visit: https://www.cemex.co.uk/<br />\nCemex R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of circular materials per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Sourcing lower carbon electricity is part of Cemex's global \"Future in Action\" strategy to combat climate change.<\/p>\n\n<p>Energy supplied to Cemex plants under the signed contract will be supplied based on a portfolio of electricity from Polish wind and photovoltaic farms. It is worth noting that the signed contract is a so-called physical energy supply contract, covering the actual energy generated from a specific group of Polish generating units supplying green energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe concluded contract is important for Cemex on several levels. The contract ensures stable supply of a large volume of electricity, while at the same time securing a guaranteed, predictable level of prices for supplied energy in the long term. This is particularly important in the context of the rapid and unpredictable changes in energy prices on the European and Polish energy markets recorded in the last several months. In addition, the partnership with Statkraft is crucial in the context of achieving the Cemex Group's sustainability goals. After all, sourcing energy from renewable sources enables a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of our production facilities,\" said Tadeusz Radzięciak, Director Cement Operations, Cemex Polska Board Member.<\/p>\n\n<p>The contract covers energy supply in the \"baseload\" product, which guarantees stable supply, of fixed amounts of energy at each hour of the day for the duration of the contract. From the point of view of both the power generator and the end user, this is the most advanced product structure in the energy market today. In addition, the contract provides greater diversification of Cemex Poland's energy purchasing portfolio.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs a leading integrator of the renewable energy market in Poland, at Statkraft we are convinced that we can drive the energy transition while supporting the competitiveness of the Polish industry. A great example of this is our partnership with Cemex Poland, where we provide a green baseload - a constant supply 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, based on our RES (renewable energy sources) portfolio which includes electricity from both wind and solar assets,\" said Pieter Schipper, VP NW European &amp; US Origination at Statkraft.<\/p>\n\n<p>Poland is the second country in the Cemex group in Europe, after Spain, to have such a contract.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex for the climate<\/p>\n\n<p>Sourcing energy from renewable sources is part of Cemex's global strategy \"Future in Action.\" Its goal is to combat climate change by, among other things, reducing carbon dioxide emissions at production facilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>As part of its sustainability efforts, Cemex Polska's product portfolio is being consistently enriched with solutions for sustainable construction.

        "Body": "<p>This is the latest sustainable development from the global building materials supplier, which includes a focus on the circular economy in its dedicated climate action strategy; Future in Action.&nbsp;<br />\nRUBBERMIX ASPHALT utilises crumb rubber, a material made from shredded waste tyres that is also used for football pitches and softplay floors. It therefore enables end-of-life tyres to be recycled, while creating new roads and new life within the tyres.<br />\nRUBBERMIX ASPHALT is perfect for both local authorities and housebuilders, as it can be incorporated into mixes for highway maintenance and newly constructed roads and pavements, while providing the same quality control and consistent product performance as a standard asphalt.<br />\nScott Jones, Director of Asphalt and Paving Solutions for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cThe UK generates over 486,000 tonnes of used tyres each year and CEMEX has identified an opportunity to incorporate some of these into its existing asphalt mixes thanks to RUBBERMIX ASPHALT, with the potential to recycle up to 500 tyres per kilometre of road.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX believes a circular economy is essential for environmental sustainability. By transforming waste materials into invaluable solutions, carbon emissions are reduced along with other environmental benefits. &nbsp;RUBBERMIX ASPHALT can also be combined with our VIALOW range of lower carbon asphalts to further increase the sustainability of a project.\u201d<br />\nThe circular economy is a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible.

        "Body": "<p>The system, the brainchild of a Cemex employee, has been trialled in Cemex\u2019s UK cement operation, where it has performed effortlessly. Not only has the use of electricity to power the discharge equipment cut emissions, but it has enabled a faster turnaround and significantly quieter delivery. Longer-term, vehicle wear and tear are also reduced.<br />\nThe benefit to the environment of incorporating this equipment into a commercial fleet is considerable; the trial has demonstrated a potential saving of over 4000kg of CO2 in a year, per vehicle using the system, as well as 330 gallons of fuel.&nbsp;<br />\nMatthew Wild, Vice President of Supply Chain and Procurement for Cemex EMEA, commented: \u201cWe have been very impressed with the results of the initial trial of the electric discharge equipment in our cement business. Every single delivery that uses this system to discharge cement, rather than the tanker\u2019s own fuel, saves 13.5kg of CO2; if this equipment was used across our fleet over a full year the difference to our supply chain emissions would be considerable.\u201d<br />\nThe idea for this new discharge equipment came from Nigel Ponton, National Fleet Engineer for the UK business. He worked with supplier Gardner Denver to create the system, which is mounted onto the tractor unit and simply requires three-phase connection to pressurise the tank and allow discharge to silo. This means no additional equipment or investment is needed at the customer\u2019s site.<br />\nMatthew added: \u201cWe believe that every member of our workforce plays a role in ensuring we reach our goal of operating as a net zero company by 2050. The development and trial of this idea demonstrates that nurturing and investing into innovation in your business helps achieve your strategic priorities. Following the successful results of this trial, we are exploring incorporating it across our wider fleet, while also looking at land-based units which can be housed at site.\u201d<br />\nCemex believes that true carbon neutrality can only be achieved by encouraging innovation and discovering breakthrough technologies.

The call is led by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership (Clean Hydrogen JU), the body that oversees EU funding and R&amp;I activities related to hydrogen, with the objective of supporting the EU Green Deal and Hydrogen Strategy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Europe currently produces 300 million tonnes of waste with the potential to produce over 30 million tons of green hydrogen. It is this potential that HYIELD aims to unlock. During the four-year project, novel technologies and processes will be integrated to efficiently and robustly convert biogenic waste streams into high purity green hydrogen at a very competitive cost, to demonstrate its application to help decarbonise different sectors, including shipping, aviation and energy intensive industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The demonstration scale waste-to-hydrogen plant will be trialled at Cemex\u2019s Alcanar cement factory in Spain. During the project, the plant is expected to process over 2,000t of waste and produce nearly 400t of green hydrogen which will be proved for different industry uses such as clean fuels, fertilizers production and others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sergio Menendez, President of Cemex EMEA, commented: \u201cAs part of its drive to reaching net zero by 2050, Cemex is committed to partnering with like-minded organisations to explore the very latest innovations in more sustainable technology that can support the cement production process. We are proud to provide one of our cement plants in Spain as the location for the HYIELD trial and excited to see the outcomes from this R&amp;D project.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Alongside Cemex, the HYIELD project consortium is under the coordination of MAGTEL and made up of other two key portfolio companies; WtEnergy Advanced Solutions and Synhelion; Spanish partners H2SITE, VEOLIA, ENAGAS, EURECAT, CETAQUA, Inveniam Group, CISC and La Farga; along with other partners from across Europe; MINCATEC, SINTEF, ARISTENG and ArcelorMittal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Senior officials of HYIELD, said: \u201cWe are delighted to be a participant of this impactful R&amp;D project that brings together a wide range of skills and experience from across research, tech, energy and heavy industry. We hope the project can open a new low-cost pathway for clean green hydrogen production in Europe, as well as creating new opportunities for waste valorisation and job creation\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>The consortium brings to the project experience in waste management, hydrogen production and thermo-chemical processes to address this challenge. The project will pave the way for commercial scale-up and replication of waste-to-hydrogen plants across Europe.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><em>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

This was then followed by presentations covering Customer Services, Cement outlook and strategy, the imminent amendment to BS 8500, a VAP and Specification update, and finally an update on the Circular Economy and recycled aggregates.<\/p>\n\n<p>After a relaxed evening of catching up with old acquaintances and meeting new ones, day two kicked off with a 2024 Outlook from Lex. This was followed by presentations about the credit outlook and the UK Economy, a security update about fraud and social media, our decarbonisation strategy and water, the dos and don\u2019ts of using LinkedIn, an update from marketing, and ended with an update on sales tools and reports and \u2018how to get the most out of them\u2019. Damon Montgomery closed the event with a positive reminder that being a strong team, with excellent people, they will weather the forthcoming challenges successfully together.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lex Russell, Managing Director Materials UK, commented: \u201cIt was fantastic to see our Readymix Commercial teams all together again. We shared some excellent business updates and some valuable social time to catch up with colleagues as well as meet new ones. The commercial team can be very proud of their performance over the last 12 months and it was a pleasure for me to be able to thank everyone in person. Many thanks to all of our presenters, Marcuss and Damon for organising the conference and to everyone for taking part in the open and varied discussions.\u201d<\/p>"

Following the trial\u2019s success, the technology has since been implemented in its plant based in Rugby, UK, with the Alicante, Spain site due to install imminently.<\/p>\n\n<p>The technology was supplied by German manufacturer Linde Material Handling. Its features include a Reverse Assist Camera for forklifts, which detects pedestrians behind reversing forklifts. In the event of danger, the technology will alert the driver and automatically reduce the speed of the forklift. Linde will also implement its \u201cSafety Guard System\u201d at hall gates of buildings where forklifts can be driven; these project warnings signs to make pedestrians and other forklift operators aware that a vehicle is entering the facility.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dietmar Voetsch, Director of Admixtures Europe, said: \u201cAt Cemex, we are always looking for new processes and innovations to ensure safety in our workplaces. Linde\u2019s Safety Guard System and Reverse Assist Camera are ideal solutions for occupational safety in our Admixtures plants; we were immediately convinced by the technology and the feedback we\u2019ve received from employees who have used it has been extremely positive. Once the European rollout is complete, we are excited to adapt the technology further for use in our Admixtures plants across the wider EMEA region.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Fabian Zimmerman, Product Manager Safety at Linde Material Handling, said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to have supported Cemex with the implementation of both the Safety Guard System and the Reverse Assist Camera at their European Admixtures Plants. By installing these systems, the safety of daily situations like loading and unloading lorries or storage can be increased significantly. We provide these solutions as a retrofit; thus, complete fleets can be equipped with these assistance systems.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Health and Safety is a core value of Cemex. It targets zero injuries across its workforce and is committed to providing and maintaining safe and healthy working conditions, equipment and systems of work, along with effective information, instructions, training and supervision to all its employees.<\/p>\n\n<p>Admixtures is a key part of Cemex\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions product portfolio, which is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of more sustainable solutions to help meet the challenges of modern urbanisation safely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/cement-admixtures\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/cement-admixtures<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

The Government has recently published its blueprint for a carbon capture industry, to assist important sectors such as cement manufacturing to reach net zero while supporting our construction needs. It was excellent to hear from leaders here in Rugby, a cement heartland in its own right, about the impact of this work and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with UK cement producers.\u201d<br />\nMartin Casey, Director Public Affairs, Communications &amp; Social Impact commented: \u201cWe were proud to welcome Lord Callanan to our Rugby Cement Plant, which plays a vital role in both the local economy and the wider national construction industry.

This system incorporates renewable energy to provide constant power whist simulating fluctuating power demands and delivers real world emissions savings.<br />\nFollowing the success of initial paper-based feasibility studies, Cemex is working in partnership with University of Warwick and advanced system integrator, iconsys, to deliver an intelligently managed shore power system demonstrator, specifically tailored to understand self-discharging commercial vessel\u2019s demanding electrical load fluctuations. It will incorporate battery energy storage and solar photovoltaic energy generation, plus integrated hardware-in-the-loop simulation to both virtually expand the capability of the system and validate modelling software predictions.<br />\nThe demonstrator will deliver constant power to the vessel alongside, after discharge at 250kW, whilst simulating the full dynamic discharge cycle (1.5MW) alongside the berth. The model enables the innovative, dynamic, multi-objective energy management system to maximise the use of lower-carbon electricity, minimising the use of engines alongside.<br />\nThis stage of the project will take place at Cemex\u2019s wharf in Shoreham, Brighton &amp; Hove, which will better allow Cemex to manage the impact of the demonstrator on its operations. Additionally, it aligns with Shoreham Port\u2019s wider sustainability goals and efforts to create a credible and measurable Local Industrial Decarbonisation Plan.&nbsp;<br />\nWork will start on this stage of the project in April, with 12 months allowed for installation and demonstration of the system to be completed and the results shared with stakeholders from the industry and Department for Transport.&nbsp;<br />\nLaurence Dagley, Operational Excellence and Business Development Director for Cemex West Europe materials commented: \u201cOur initial feasibility study for this shore power system identified an opportunity to save a significant amount of CO2 during each dredger discharge, while also improving local air quality at the port itself. We are therefore pleased to have received this funding to progress to the next stage of the project and undertake on-site demonstration.<br />\n\u201cThe timings for this stage are tight but the potential benefits are considerable, as it will allow us to gain real experience of all the hardware, in a real environment, whilst being able to study full scale operation and quantify the benefits. Utilising the Cemex Go Innovation, already the newest and most advanced aggregates dredger in the industry, this will be the first dredger in the UK to be shore powered and marks an exciting progression in our efforts to decarbonise.\u201d<br />\nJordan Tassell, Head of Marine &amp; Ports for iconsys, commented: \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity to progress towards a demonstration of the smart shore power system, a cutting-edge solution that goes beyond the standard. The aim is to offer key functionality and benefits that will support uptake within the maritime sector and drive the future of vessel connectivity.<br />\n\u201ciconsys is driven by the ambition to develop our specialised skillset in this domain, leveraging this demonstration project as a strategic platform. Our commitment is not just limited to system integration; we aim to detail, design, and manufacture a solution that sets a benchmark in efficiency and reliability. This venture aligns with our broader vision of pushing the boundaries of innovation and playing a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of smart, connected ports and vessels.\"<br />\nDr Andrew McGordon, Reader in the Energy Applications Group at WMG, University of Warwick commented \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate the learnings form the feasibility study using an innovative mix of real and virtual hardware, to understand the operational challenges of decarbonising this sector whilst developing state of the art energy management strategies to maximise CO2 emissions savings.\u201d<br />\nThis project is part of the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean-maritime-demonstration-competition-cmdc\"> Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition Round 4 (CMDC4)<\/a>, funded by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) and delivered by Innovate UK.

        "Body": "<p>In our European cement operations, we have already reduced our CO2 intensity by nearly 45% compared to 1990 and have an ambitious plan to reach 55% reduction by 2030, in line with the EU\u2019s \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 aspirations. Cemex is investing significantly in solutions to reduce CO2 emissions to the extent that is currently technically possible. However, the production of cement inevitably gives rise to some CO2 emissions, including biogenic. Therefore, Cemex &nbsp;requires the completion of the policy landscape for carbon management to fully decarbonise its operations and make fast investment decisions.<br />\nCommenting on the Communication, Martin Casey, Director Communications, Public Affairs &amp; Social Impact for Cemex EMEA, says: \u201cThe strategy is comprehensive and outlines relevant fields of action but what is essential now is a timely implementation. For companies to move forward, the regulatory framework regarding CCU/S along with carbon accounting and removals must be completed as a matter of the utmost urgency. The cement plant of 2030 is planned and designed today.\u201d<br />\nExploiting the full potential of biogenic emissions from cement production&nbsp;<br />\nSignificantly increasing the share of alternative fuels in the cement plants\u2019 fuel mixes in the coming decade is an integral part of Cemex\u2019s decarbonisation strategy. As a result, Cemex\u2019s cement plants are a reliable source of emissions from more sustainable biomass and contribute to carbon removals in case of permanent storage.&nbsp;<br />\nCemex therefore appreciates that permanent storage of biogenic CO2 from industry has been recognised as one of the major pathways of industrial carbon management in the EU and both supports and advocates for the integration of scientifically sound industrial carbon removal from various sources and technologies into the EU-ETS.<br />\nDevelopment of a dense European CO2 transport and storage infrastructure to reduce costs.<br />\nThe development of CO2 transport infrastructure has been rightly identified as a priority by the European Commission. Operational expenditures for CCS will be driven by transportation and storage costs to a significant extent. To render the industry\u2019s transformation economically viable, the European Union and its Member States should develop a dense and readily accessible network of CO2 pipelines, connecting storage sites to both industrial hubs and dispersed industrial sites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The global construction materials company Cemex and Orcan Energy AG, the leading cleantech company turning waste heat into clean electricity, will analyze the scale-up of the heat-to-power solutions pioneered by Orcan Energy in parallel at several Cemex plants to capitalize on the benefits resulting from a portfolio of installations. The representative findings will be collected to draw a holistic picture for an upcoming global waste heat recovery program. The portfolio approach with detailed multi-site data collection allows the partners to efficiently and quickly deploy Orcan Energy\u2019s modular applications at scale in the second phase of the collaboration.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sergio Menéndez, President of Cemex Europe, Middle East, Africa &amp; Asia, said: \u201cWe already have an initial collaboration with Orcan. Based on the modularity of their solution, Orcan offers the flexibility of both installation and contracts. Thanks to this crucial flexibility, we can adapt to any upcoming changes in our plants. The approach enables us to reduce carbon emissions right now without limiting ourselves in implementing any future technologies such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage. This partnership will help us achieve our sustainability targets and contribute to our aim to use all available heat.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Andreas Sichert, CEO of Orcan Energy, said: \u201cWe are looking forward to entering this large-scale decarbonization partnership with Cemex after our initial cooperation in Germany. This step is a testament to Cemex\u2019s forward-looking strategy and the company\u2019s commitment to achieving net zero. For Orcan Energy, this is another milestone in scaling the business internationally with global enterprises. We are proud to be the partner of choice for the cement industry. Our large footprint across the industry shows the economic capability and the technical excellence of our modular and flexible solution, especially in view of uncertain future economic and regulative developments.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2021, Cemex and Orcan Energy started their first joint project in Rüdersdorf, Germany, near Berlin, with the installation of six waste heat recovery modules which could produce up to 8,000 megawatt hours per year, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 3,000 tons. Following this ongoing cooperation, the companies decided to enter a large-scale decarbonization partnership, exploring the deployment of waste heat recovery solutions in several further sites, multiplying today\u2019s electricity savings and CO2 reductions.<\/p>\n\n<p>In industrial production, usually 30-60% of the energy is lost in the form of heat. Cement production is particularly energy and CO2-intensive. Therefore, the cement industry is actively searching for ways to reduce carbon emissions and utilize its waste heat. Modular waste heat recovery technology is a proven and commercially viable energy efficiency solution that can be flexibly installed in several applications. The heat-to-power modules can be placed at the pre-heater as well as the clinker cooler. Both heat sources can either be utilized combined or separately. If the waste heat availability changes over time, the modules can be redeployed at other waste heat sources and sites or even be returned. Thanks to this flexibility, various other heat users can be included in the future \u2013 the heat extraction will retain its value in any event.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About Orcan Energy<\/p>\n\n<p>Orcan Energy AG develops, produces, distributes and finances energy modules for the conversion of waste heat into clean and cheap electricity and constructs them on a turnkey basis, including the installation required for waste heat extraction. Orcan Energy's products tap into the enormous global waste heat potential and enable customers to save CO2 emissions and costs at the same time. Orcan Energy unlocks the energy potential of unused heat sources based on second-generation Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology. By massively downsizing the established technology and developing a modular solution, Orcan Energy is turning small and medium-sized waste heat sources, as well as lower temperatures into economically viable options for the first time. As a result, the modules can be installed directly wherever excess heat is generated, for example in industrial processes, in engines, on ships or even in geothermal plants. Orcan Energy's solutions are already helping companies in the cement, oil and gas, power generation, and marine sectors to achieve their sustainability goals, reduce costs and comply with future regulations. Thanks to flexible financing models, companies can save cash-flow-positive electricity or fuel costs with waste heat power generation from day one. Orcan Energy has already marketed more than 650 modules with over 7 million operating hours internationally. The company has more than 60 employees and is headquartered in Munich, Germany.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about the company, its products and applications, visit <a href=\"about:blank\">www.orcan-energy.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.

        "Body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Vialayer is an enhanced Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) surface course which has been specially developed to provide an advanced high grade solution against the main causes of road defects in urban environments.&nbsp; Using a combination of a selected aggregate grading and a high volume of Polymer Modified Bitumen Vialayer can help local authorities to reduce the frequency and cost of maintenance needed for pavements, and highly trafficked roads. It also offers greater flexibility allowing it to absorb the stresses of urban traffic and withstand the impact of slow, heavy-moving vehicles like buses in bus lanes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Scott Jones, Director of Asphalt, Cemex UK said: \u201cWith Vialayer we have worked hard to provide a solution to help local authorities manage their ever increasing maintenance costs. According to a recent Government report, road maintenance has dropped to the lowest level in five years, putting local councils under a tremendous amount of pressure to reduce spending and allocate resources efficiently. With less money available to carry out road maintenance, councils must be confident in the materials they use for projects, without causing greater expenses in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany urban streets were built for much lower traffic volumes than they experience today, with limited capacity for increased thickness. Often when maintenance work is carried out, it creates trenches which, when overlaid with conventional asphalt mixes, can lead to problems with reflective cracking. This significantly reduces the lifespan of the asphalt surface, causing the same problems to re-occur frequently, often within months of the work being completed. Vialayer offers a highly effective solution to this growing problem. It also exhibits very low noise from the road and tyre interface as a result of the negative textured surface \u2013 which is beneficial in an urban environment. By cutting down the ongoing road maintenance requirements, Vialayer also will contribute to reduced traffic delays for busy towns and streets.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is committed to developing a more sustainable approach to road and highway maintenance and construction, through continued investment into innovation and circularity, by incorporating waste sources from other streams into its materials. In tandem, the company is focussed on the advancement of its portfolio of more sustainable asphalt products and solutions. These demonstrate lower carbon embodiedment, use of recycled materials and increased water conservation to meet customer and environmental demand; ultimately building a better future for everyone.<\/p>\n\n<p>The launch of Vialayer asphalt, follows the introduction of Viaflex SAMI (Stress Alleviating Membrane Interlayer), earlier this year, which is specifically designed for overlays onto concrete, cement bound bases or where movement of underlying pavement layers is likely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Viaflex SAMI offers an extremely flexible asphalt mix designed to absorb stresses caused by natural thermal movement and high trafficking, and sees Cemex continue to broaden its portfolio of Asphalt products and solutions targeted at bringing innovative solutions to everyday challenges faced across the construction, infrastructure and highways industries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both Vialayer and Viaflex SAMI are available as part of Cemex\u2019s Urbanisation Asphalt Solutions portfolio.

        "Body": "<p>Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) is a diesel-like biofuel that can be produced without fossil resources by processing renewable waste. HVO is now one of the leading alternative renewable fuels available to the construction industry, producing up to 90% less CO2 emissions than traditional diesel fuel; and will act as a transitional fuel, helping to lower CO2 emissions whilst the industry moves towards more longer-term solutions such as electric or hydrogen power.<\/p>\n\n<p>The vehicle will be operating out of Cemex\u2019s Tilbury cement plant, which sits on the River Thames and serves the London and South East building and construction markets. Cemex\u2019s Tilbury cement plant has achieved the ISO14001 environmental accreditation, and the addition of the new HVO-powered vehicle is another example of Cemex\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex aims to lead the industry in its approach to creating a more sustainable future through it\u2019s Future in Action programme which sets out a combined approach to tackling climate change by reducing carbon emissions, introducing circularity into its operations, and increasing biodiversity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alongside its continued progress to decarbonise operations in order to reach net zero by 2050, Cemex is also taking innovative approaches to creating lower carbon building and construction materials through its Vertua range, increasing biodiversity through vital restoration work at its quarry locations and finding ways to reduce carbon emissions across its supply chain through increased rail activities and the use of alternative fuels such as HVO.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dave Hart, Director of Supply Chain for the UK, says, \u201cThe introduction of the new HVO-powered vehicle at our Tilbury plant is another important step on our journey towards reducing carbon emissions within our HGV fleet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Electric and hydrogen powered alternatives are either still in development or do not yet have the range or the infrastructure to be supported across our larger vehicle fleet.<\/p>\n\n<p>HVO biofuel therefore, provides us with the opportunity for us to reduce carbon emissions, acting as a transitional fuel, whilst we continue to assess other emerging technologies such as electric and hydrogen power.\u201d<\/p>"

Recent changes to BS8500, the complimentary British Standard to the European concrete standard EN206, now allow Cemstone to be used in combination with other additions to produce concrete suitable across a wide range of Exposure Classes and therefore specifiers and concrete producers can select and produce even lower carbon concretes that supports the industries drive to Net Zero by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>Craig Williamson, Cement Commercial Director for the UK, \u201cThis is another important step on our journey to produce more sustainable cement products for our customers and provide them with the confidence they need to ensure that they are able to meet their own sustainable building and construction ambitions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The CEM II A-L variety (Cemstone), sits within Cemex\u2019s Vertua product portfolio which includes building materials with attributes that demonstrate either a lower carbon embodiment, the use of recycled materials, improved thermal efficiency, increased water conservation or design optimisation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua range produced by Cemex includes its CEM II A-L varieties of cement, readymix concrete and also extends to products including sprayed concrete, dry-silo and bagged mortar, and asphalt.<\/p>\n\n<p>Designing more sustainable products and solutions is a key pillar of Cemex\u2019s global Future in Action programme alongside decarbonising its operations, promoting a circular economy and enhancing biodiversity \u2013 with the ultimate goal of becoming a net zero business by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>This news follows the announcement made by Cemex at the end of 2023, that it had achieved EPDs for products produced in Croatia and Spain and was continuing to pursue EPDs for its products across its EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia) operations, which it has now achieved in both the UK and Poland.<\/p>"

July 18, 2024 \u2013 Cemex announced today that it has signed a Network Partnership agreement with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to accelerate circular economy efforts in the built environment. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Network is the world\u2019s leading circular economy network, working with ambitious, like-minded organizations globally.",

        "Body": "<p>As a Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network, Cemex will continue integrating and scaling circular economy principles into the cement supply chain through its Regenera business while leveraging science-based research, advocacy, and coalition-building initiatives to drive circularity forward in the building materials industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cSince 2023, with the launch of our Regenera business, we have strengthened our focus on circularity as an essential component of our strategy. Through Regenera, we are providing circularity solutions to extend the life cycle of products and reduce the use of virgin materials,\u201d said Fernando A. González, CEO of Cemex. \u201cThe Partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation presents a tremendous opportunity to further drive Cemex\u2019s leadership in the transition of the built environment towards a circular economy.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe built environment sector has a huge role to play in the transition to a circular economy, and Cemex have shown their intent to be a key player by joining our Network. As a leader in the construction industry, we look forward to supporting their circular economy journey through this long-term collaboration and showcasing the potential of innovative circular practices within the building materials industry,\u201d said Joe Murphy, Executive of the Business Network at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The United Nations found that in 2021 the buildings and construction sector emitted historic levels of CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately 37% of global CO2 emissions. Incorporating circular economy principles into the built environment can create more sustainable and liveable urban areas, reduce global CO2 emissions from building materials by 38% by 2050, and enhance sector resilience to supply chain disruptions and raw material price volatility.<\/p>\n\n<p>A circular economy helps tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and other global challenges by decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. The Foundation is working to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, that is based on three principles driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s Regenera recovered over 9 million tons of construction and demolition waste (CDEW) in 2023, marking a 5% increase over the prior year. As a result, construction-related waste has been effectively utilized and treated as raw materials for aggregates in concrete production, reintegrating them into the construction value chain and reducing the environmental impact of the industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regenera is part of Future in Action, Cemex's program to achieve sustainable excellence through climate action, circularity, and natural resource management with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Ellen MacArthur Foundation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is an international charity that develops and promotes the circular economy in order to tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. We work with our network of private and public sector decision-makers, as well as academia, to build capacity, explore collaborative opportunities, and design and develop circular economy initiatives and solutions. Increasingly based on renewable energy, a circular economy is driven by design to eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature, to create resilience and prosperity for business, the environment, and society.<\/p>"

The new facility at Alrewas opened in 2023 without mains electricity which means the site, until recently has been exclusively powered by diesel generators. Keen to reduce CO2 and the reliance on fossil fuels, the Operational Excellence team were quickly able to reduce the night-time diesel generator usage by 68%, once the renewable power units were installed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Steven Coles Operational Excellence Manager, West Europe Materials, comments: \u201cCemex is embracing all forms of new innovations and ideas in the quest to lower our carbon footprint. As our operations transition towards net zero, we are all enjoying the experience of designing and utilising new technology, with batteries and other forms of renewable energy. Cemex\u2019s intensive training with the Renewables Institute has enabled us to skill up in this critical area. It is empowering in itself to have completed several renewable projects over the past year and to now have more exciting projects in the pipeline.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Spencer, VP for Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM, added: \u201cIt is inspiring to witness our Future in Action programme sparking high levels of ingenuity and creativity within our workforce. The renewables installation at Alrewas is attractive in both payback and CO2 reduction, as well as being replicable across other operations that are not able to be connected to the electricity grid. The future here is bright!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result of the success at Alrewas, a second battery and solar unit installation is now planned at Cemex\u2019s Hamer Warren quarry, in the New Forest, Hampshire. The same renewable energy technology will be utilised at Hamer Warren to reduce diesel consumption during the plant\u2019s onsite pumping activities.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the forefront of the circular economy in the construction value chain, Cemex is pioneering ways to increase the use of alternative fuels across its operations as well as waste and residues as alternative raw materials. Providing cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and urbanisation solutions in growing markets around the world, Cemex is powered by a multinational workforce which is focused on delivering a superior customer experience, enabled by digital technologies.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.cemex.com\">www.cemex.com<\/a> &nbsp;<\/p>"

Further Lend a Hand opportunities for colleagues based at Binley are now being planned. They have recently received National Lottery funding which has been invested in large fridge/freezer storage facilities and a kitchen facility on site. This means they can now provide fresh produce in their food parcels, including fresh soups made on site. The recipients of the parcels will therefore be receiving healthy, fresh, and nutritious food (not just baked beans and rice!).<\/p>\n\n<p>The wider aid they provide to children in Zimbabwe and South Africa continues to grow, with a new program rolled out to educate UK school children on the Global food crisis, which involves the children helping to weigh and pack the food for shipping to Africa.<\/p>\n\n<p>While there last year, the team offered some operational improvements to the Foodbank manager and they were delighted to see, on this recent visit, that some of their ideas have now implemented. As a result, the speed of their packing process has increased and several of their volunteers commented about the improvements.<\/p>\n\n<p>The team reported back that the Foodbank were desperately short of certain items and so collection is being arranged at our Head Office for people to donate specific items.<\/p>\n\n<p>Volunteering is part of Cemex\u2019s commitment to sustainable development, and all employees are encouraged to actively engage in activities that contribute to improving the quality of life and well-being in cities and communities where we live and operate.<\/p>"

The trees and bushes around the green were either over grown or dead and the surrounding fence was rotten and collapsing.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was decided to organise a Lend a Hand event to trim back the greenery, replace the fence and add some plant pots for colour. Firstly, we had to approach Steve Morten who owns and runs Town &amp; Country bagging plant which is situated here at the Dove Holes site. Steve originates from Small Dale and was only too happy to purchase the materials needed which included three used beer barrels from Buxton Brewery which Steve Croft professionally cut in half for us to use as planters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next step was to plan a dry day to do the work and in early September (2023) Michael Craven led a small team from the night shift to complete the task. At various times of the day different locals turned up to help out or just to show their appreciation which was a great help and made the event feel very worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n<p>After the event Angela was in touch to thank Cemex and Steve from Town and Country. She said the event had \u2018lifted\u2019 the locals into action with garden gates being painted, flowers planted, and grass verges cut to perfection. \u201cYou must come back in spring for photo\u2019s when the bulbs we\u2019ve planted have flowered\u201d she said.

We\u2019ve had a truck, we\u2019ve had safety equipment and we\u2019ve had children climbing into the cab. All classes have had a presentation where road safety has been explained to the children. You only have to look at the media to see how many deaths and accidents happen on the roads. Our children are very young so it\u2019s something we find very important here. You hear about accidents with cyclists and a lot of it is because they don\u2019t understand that lorry drivers can\u2019t always see them. So it\u2019s really about an awareness.

        "Body": "<p>The grant has been awarded as part of a consortium which Cemex will lead, working in partnership with Galliford Try, Sika, Northumbria Water and the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester, and totals around £400k.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mike Higgins, National Technical Manager for Cemex UK, commented that \u201cThe funding further demonstrates our continued commitment to developing more sustainable construction materials and bringing them to market.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is a great example of how partnership working across the construction sector and alongside academic institutions and can drive innovative new approaches that aim to bring about additional benefits for the built environment, as it continues its journey towards a more sustainable future.\u201d<br />\nThe project proposes an innovative approach to decarbonising concrete by integrating micronized limestone and graphene-based admixtures into the concrete mix, targeting the reduction of embodied carbon emissions associated with concrete production.<\/p>\n\n<p>This innovation addresses the challenge by reducing the reliance on Ordinary Portland Cement, which is responsible for a significant portion of concrete's carbon emissions. The use of micronized limestone as a supplementary cementitious material reduces the need for Ordinary Portland Cement, thereby decreasing CO2 emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, incorporating graphene, a novel 2D material, enhances the mechanical properties of the concrete, allowing for the use of higher supplementary cementitious material content without compromising early age strength development.<\/p>\n\n<p>The core innovation lies in the synergy between micronized limestone and graphene. Micronized limestone, with its fine particle size and high surface area, contributes to improved particle packing and hydration reactions in the concrete mix, enhancing strength and durability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The addition of graphene helps to ensure that when used in conjunction with a high supplementary cementitious material content, including micronized limestone, the mix yields lower carbon concrete with traditional or reduced curing time. This extends the use of low carbon supplementary cementitious materials to applications where traditional strength development is needed to meet programme requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>Graphene-enhanced concrete can also be used like standard concrete, which means that no new equipment or training is required in the batching or laying process. As well as benefitting from a reduction in CO2 emissions, this also has the potential to be commercially viable for the customer without additional costs, often associated with new ways of working, being incurred.<\/p>\n\n<p>James Baker, CEO at Graphene@Manchester, added: The bid further strengthens GEIC\u2019s reputation to work with industry and its supply chain for the scale-up and commercialisation of graphene. The potential for graphene-enhanced concrete to significantly reduce CO2 emissions during manufacturing is a major step forward in sustainable construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Higgins goes on to add that, \u201cThe commercial potential of this innovation is substantial, given the urgent need for more sustainable building materials in the face of global climate challenges. Our proposal encompasses a comprehensive plan from laboratory development to real-world application, ensuring the solution is not only technically viable but also commercially viable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/documents/45807659/0/Aggregatres-Tipper-Cemex-logo.jpg/3343eb9a-a74b-911d-9e9e-f7e65191a584?t=1722939146095\" /><\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<br />\nCemex has the primary objective to become a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

Earlier this year, Cemex partnered with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the world\u2019s leading circular economy network that works with ambitious, like-minded organizations globally to continue to leverage the potential of the cement value chain in circularity.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About HEIM Group<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The HEIM Group, based in Ulm, Germany, was founded in 1919 as a paving company. Today, the group employs around 550 people at locations in Ulm, Thuringia, Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin and has expanded its portfolio to include building materials extraction, recycling and agriculture in addition to construction. The group has also been active in the field of renewable energies for 20 years. The recycling plant in Berlin-Marzahn was acquired by the Heim Group in 2001. Since then, mineral building materials such as bricks and concrete have been recycled in Bitterfelder Strasse and electricity has been generated by a photovoltaic system.

As the new Member of Parliament, one of my priorities is to break down barriers to opportunity, so I wholeheartedly support this event and wish the organisers and attendees every success. Here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s the first of many Marine Open Days to come.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex, in collaboration with Solent Careers Hub and Southampton City Council, hosted the open day to provide valuable career guidance, offer students insights into career pathways at Cemex and ultimately to help students make informed decisions about their futures.<\/p>\n\n<p>The day started with an overview of the role Cemex plays in providing essential building materials that help to create new homes, schools, hospitals, leisure facilities and other vital infrastructure both locally and across the UK.<\/p>\n\n<p>Students had the opportunity to explore how aggregates are extracted, processed and then used in products such as cement, mortar and readymix concrete. There was also the opportunity to understand how Cemex\u2019s Sustainability teams support the business with its aim to become a carbon net zero business by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>As well as building and construction materials, students also learned of the many other uses for minerals including foods, medicines, toothpaste and water \u2013 introducing students to an industry that significantly contributes to enhancing quality of life, education, and wellbeing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kurt Cowdery, General Manager for Cemex\u2019s Marine operations in the UK commented that, \u201cWe have created this event to ensure these students have real-world encounters with professionals while providing practical insights and essential employability skills. Our collaboration with Solent Careers Hub not only benefits students but also helps us as a business in shaping the skills we need for a more sustainable future.<\/p>\n\n<p>We want to introduce the young people to the industry and potential career opportunities that they may not otherwise have known about. We were delighted to welcome the students and hope they all had an enjoyable day whilst also learning more about the opportunities within our industry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The highlight of the day was the opportunity for students to go aboard the Cemex Go Innovation, Cemex\u2019s flagship vessel, where they were given a tour of the ship and introduced to the vigorous safety procedures that are applied by Cemex\u2019s Marine team as well as the operational and engineering activities that enable Cemex\u2019s Marine team to provide vital minerals for use in local and national building and construction projects.<\/p>\n\n<p>The event was supported by exhibitors from across the industry including The Crown Estate, Wessex Archaeology, The Ship Safe Training Group \u2013 who support the British Merchant Navy with training activities, Minerals Matter and Maritime UK Solent.<\/p>"

The raw CO2 is then compressed and liquefied so that it meets the purity requirements for subsequent sequestration. Finally, the liquid CO2 product will be transported by rail to an intermediate CO2 Hub and shipped to an offshore storage site in the North Sea for permanent storage. The environmental credentials of this full chain CCUS project at Rüdersdorf will be further enhanced and supported by the regional generation of green electricity and the recycling of water obtained from the condensation of exhaust gases. CCUS is part of the roadmap for Future in Action, Cemex's sustainability and decarbonization program, with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050. Through Future in Action, Cemex has achieved record-breaking progress in reducing its carbon footprint since its launch in 2020.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>The global construction materials supplier&nbsp;\u2013 who provide a range of products in the UK from cement, readymix concrete and aggregates to complimentary urbanisation solutions which include asphalts, mortars and admixtures alongside pre-cast concrete products \u2013 continue to invest in their rail operations to support the transportation of vital building materials to the industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mark Grimshaw-Smith, Rail and Sea Manager for Cemex in the UK said, \u201cThe renewal of our rail terminal operations contract at Dove Holes is a demonstration of our continued commitment to rail as a safe, effective and more sustainable mode of transport and our partnership with Victa Railfreight is critical in the shunting, placement and planning management of our rail schedules across the wider rail network.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Rail transportation plays a key part in Cemex\u2019s UK supply chain activities at its Dove Holes quarry, from which it transports around 3 million tonnes of aggregates a year. This is then dispatched to receiving depots around the UK for use in a wide range of building, construction and infrastructure projects, with Victa Railfreight also coordinating the provision of facilities for customers to collect materials from the quarry using their own rail providers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex has significantly grown its rail operations over recent years and now has rail transport links at 12 of its sites in the UK with plans to increase this in the near future.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s Director of Supply Chain for the UK, Dave Hart, comments that, \u201cRail is an integral part of our transport operation at Cemex, and aligns with our global Future in Action strategy of reducing our CO2 emissions. Delivery by train produces around 50% less CO2 per ton-mile than a road vehicle, largely in part to their ability to carry significantly increased volumes of materials. We\u2019re extremely proud of the growth that we have seen across our rail operations at Cemex in recent years, and of the contribution that this has made to our overall sustainability commitments. It remains a key focus area which we intend to continue to grow, and it will play an ever-increasing role in our supply chain network.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Alongside supporting Cemex with their rail operations at Dove Holes, Victa Railfreight provides a wide range of services to customers and suppliers in the freight industry throughout the UK. Since forming in 1995 the company has constantly adapted to the evolving landscape of the rail freight industry and their product portfolio now provides a range of operational, safety and logistics services to rail freight operators and customers across the UK.<\/p>\n\n<p>Victa Railfreight\u2019s Managing Director, Neil Sime, said \u201cwe are delighted to have renewed our partnership with Cemex at Dove Holes. Over the past five years we have worked hard to provide a safe, high quality and responsive service and to work with Cemex and the other FOC\u2019s to maximise the volumes out of Dove Holes and deliver a very high level of performance, consistently delivering 99% plus of all outbound trains \u2018on time and in full\u2019 to the trunk rail operators\u2019 at the departure point for onwards haulage.<\/p>\n\n<p>This level of service is testament to our dedicated team of Rail Logistics Operators, all of whom have been recruited new to the rail industry and have been trained in house to handle the shunting and main line loco driving duties required to fulfil our operation at Dove Holes. In addition, our contract management adds enormous value by dealing with the interfaces and liaison with all parties to optimise resource utilisation and quickly respond to service disruption and volume fluctuations.<\/p>\n\n<p>This commitment, coupled with a high level of cooperation between the parties has been a key driver in the growth of rail volumes from the quarry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is an industry leading global construction materials and solutions company that is building a better future through more sustainable products and solutions. Cemex is committed to achieving carbon neutrality through relentless innovation and industry-leading research and development. Cemex is at the forefront of the circular economy in the construction value chain and is pioneering ways to increase the use of waste and residues as alternative raw materials and fuels in its operations with the use of new technologies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex offers cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and urbanisation solutions in growing markets around the world, powered by a multinational workforce focused on providing a superior customer experience, enabled by digital technologies.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information please visit: <a href=\"http://www.cemex.com\">www.cemex.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"

For the month of June the site was 85% self-sufficient using the energy from the solar panels and wind turbine, and this is not only helping to reduce our energy costs but is also helping reduce our carbon footprint.<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations Manager, Ross Cotterell, added: \u201cOur investment in the installation of a wind turbine and solar panels at our Avonmouth Wharf will not only harnesses the power of renewable energy but also paves the way for a sustainable future for the site. The investment at Avonmouth over the past 18 months, which is clear for all to see, demonstrates the commitment from Cemex to cementing future within the South West.\u201d<\/p>"

He completed his Apprenticeship in 1980 and was asked by Greg Anson to become Engineering Supervisor at Hindlow, also part of Staveley Industries. Steve worked alongside the Works Engineer, Jack Barker, for around six months, when Jack then took early retirement due to ill health, at which time Steve then took over as Works Engineer. He then went on to perform various roles at Hindlow including Quarry Manager and Production Manager, and around 1984 Staveley was taken over by RMC.<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve left Hindlow in 1997 and came back to Dove Holes as Assistant Quarry Manager under the Directorship of Mike Lenagh. In 1998 he became the Engineering Manager under Mike, who left a few years later and was succeeded by Martin Downey. In 2005 Cemex completed its acquisition of RMC and in 2008 Steve became Quarry Manager/Engineering Manager.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kevin Cage, Head of UK Aggregate Operations, has worked with Steve since 1990 and sent the following message for Steve: \u201cI would personally like to thank Steve for his hard work, dedication and commitment to our company over the years. Steve was one of the first people I met when I joined the team at Hindlow as a management trainee. I have a lot to thank him for in those first two years he and his team taught me a lot most of which I still use today. 50 years is an incredible achievement, and we wish him all the best in the years to come. Thank you Steve, and many congratulations on achieving this special milestone!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve will be celebrating his significant milestone with the Operations team from Dove Holes quarry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Joining Steve in his celebrations at the end of this month will be his daughter, Samantha Culshaw, and his son, Adrian, who are both celebrating their 12<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;year working for Cemex! Sam started as an Area Sales Manager in Concrete Products and has progressed to National Sales Manager, and Adrian began working on the Weighbridge at Dove Holes on nights and is now an Electrician in the quarry.

        "Body": "<p>The partnership began in 2009 and was created to improve outcomes for both species and habitats, in particular through restoring quarries once they have reached the end of their working life.<\/p>\n\n<p>These restoration projects now cover over 600 hectares of grasslands; over 177 hectares of woodland; 100 hectares of heathland, and 190 hectares of ponds and open water with more than 100,000 trees planted in the process. In providing much needed habitat for a diverse range wildlife, the former quarry land is now providing homes for 46 threatened species of bird, including Willow Tit, Twite, Chough and Turtle Doves.<\/p>\n\n<p>The anniversary was celebrated with a special event at The Lodge, the RSPB\u2019s headquarters in Sandy, Bedfordshire, where teams from both organisations reflected on the success of the partnership to date and discussed priorities for the future. With plans to continue the collaboration, it is hoped that learnings from the project can help influence policy and practices to better benefit nature and the response to climate change across the sector.<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Spencer, Vice President for Sustainability and Corporate Affairs at Cemex, said \u201cThis partnership is great example of what can be achieved through long term collaboration that fosters a deep level of trust and transparency. It continues to make good business and economic sense, and has delivered positive outcomes for nature and society, with over 1,750 hectares of priority habitat having been restored to date. I\u2019m excited to see what we can achieve together over the next 15 years.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Moving forwards, Cemex will continue to prioritise its partnership with the RSPB to enhance biodiversity, and this forms one of the six pillars of its global Future in Action programme, which sets out the roadmap for Cemex to become a carbon net zero business by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>By incorporating biodiversity considerations from the earliest stages of quarry planning, the partnership is helping to minimise environmental impact and create a positive lasting legacy. The development of a habitat-mapping roadmap is enabling Cemex to measure the current levels of biodiversity at its sites, to ensure that its restoration work can be recorded and measured through the establishment of a series of metrics.<\/p>\n\n<p>This will support Cemex\u2019s future biodiversity programme, Nature Positive by 2030, which focuses on baselining biodiversity levels at existing sites and implementing strategies to increase biodiversity on all sites over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>The success of the partnership in the UK has been an important model to also inform conservation efforts elsewhere, including through Birdlife International partners across Europe. Developing partnerships within other European Operations, Cemex continues to cement its commitment to enhance biodiversity as responsible stewards of the land it manages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, commented that, \u201cTogether with Cemex, we've restored habitats, supported threatened bird species, and demonstrated the power of business conservation collaboration within the UK and beyond. As we navigate future challenges and continue in partnership to advocate for industry-wide support of these practices, we're excited to continue our work, towards a shared vision of a thriving natural world for us all to enjoy\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sean Cassidy, Biodiversity Manager across Cemex\u2019s European teams, comments that, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a real improvement in the quality of our restoration work over the period of the partnership, and this is a direct result of working closely with the RSPB, who bring specialist knowledge, skills and expertise in this area. It\u2019s also a result of the dedication of our site managers and their teams and our ability to better support them with measuring the effectiveness of this vital work.\u201d<\/p>"

        "Summary": "Cemex celebrates 1 million tonnes of alternative fuel used at its Rugby Cement Plant, thanks to its partnership with SUEZ recycling and recovery and its industry-leading Malpass farm facility. The partnership has helped to reduce coal consumption by over 750,000 tonnes at the Rugby plant, in addition to downstream carbon emissions savings from supply chain activities that would previously have been associated with shipping and transporting coal to site.",

        "Body": "<p>SUEZ works with Cemex, a leading provider of cement and building materials, to produce an alternative fuel to heat the kiln at its cement plant in Rugby, Warwickshire. As well as using Climafuel® to heat the process at Rugby, the ash that is produced from this is then also incorporated into the clinker produced in the kiln, which is the primary ingredient for the cement making process.<\/p>\n\n<p>During a visit to mark the milestone, Environment Minister Mary Creagh was shown how the facility uses household, commercial and industrial waste to produce the alternative fuel, called Climafuel®.<\/p>\n\n<p>SUEZ processes non-recyclable waste at its purpose-built facility in Rugby to produce the sustainable replacement for coal and oil. The facility creates the high-energy fuel from carefully sifted and shredded waste primarily from local authority waste collections, as well as from businesses across the Midlands, which is then used to heat the kiln at the neighbouring Cemex facility for cement production.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since the facility opened in 2015, 1 million tonnes of Climafuel® has been provided to Cemex, allowing the building materials provider to supply their customers with more sustainable products including cement, readymix concrete and specialised urbanisation solutions such as mortars, admixtures and pre-cast concrete solutions. These materials are then used for a variety of vital building, construction and infrastructure projects across the UK including new homes, schools and hospitals as well as national road and rail improvements.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dr Adam Read MBE, Chief External Affairs and Sustainability Officer said, \u201cThe waste and resources industry is at the very heart of tackling the climate crisis. Our sector underpins green transitions across a number of industries, including providing a resource for alternative fuels to allow industries such as the construction industry to become more circular.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have been working in partnership with Cemex since 2013 and it\u2019s fantastic to see such a milestone achieved as the UK looks to decarbonise as one of the ways to cut its global emissions. It is a real win-win for both our customer and the environment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The use of Climafuel® not only supports the transition away from fossil fuels and provides a reliable source of energy, but also provides customers with a long-term sustainable solution for their waste materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Circular Economy Minister Mary Creagh said, \u201cWe know far too many of our precious resources are going to waste and that we need bold, innovative approaches to maximise their value.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis government is committed to cutting waste and moving to a circular economy so that we keep resources in use for longer, accelerate the path to net zero, and increase investment in critical infrastructure and green jobs.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhere waste cannot be avoided, it is essential to explore what other benefits it can provide \u2013 such as in energy generation. That\u2019s why I was delighted to visit SUEZ\u2019s Malpass Farm facility today as they celebrated their significant milestone, providing a shining example of partnership working in action.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Phil Baynes-Clarke, Director of Cement Operations for Cemex UK, said: \u201cOur global Future in Action programme underscores our commitment to achieving carbon net zero by 2050. Our partnership with SUEZ has been instrumental in significantly reducing carbon emissions at our Rugby Cement Plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cSince 2013, we have collaborated closely with SUEZ to produce Climafuel®, a waste-derived, non-fossil-based alternative fuel used to heat the kiln in the cement-making process. This partnership is a great example of how the cement and waste management industries can work together to deliver circularity solutions that cut carbon emissions and divert waste from landfills.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOver the past decade, Climafuel® usage has steadily increased at our Rugby Cement Plant. Our ultimate goal is to operate the kiln with 100% alternative fuels, and we are getting close to this target. Through ongoing innovation, we are determined to continue decarbonising our operations and advancing towards our goal of carbon neutrality.\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The drill was meticulously planned and executed as a real-time incident to provide a realistic training environment. This approach aimed to foster collaboration with the Fire and Rescue service, including their control room, and to establish strong working relationships. Additionally, it offered Cemex site staff with valuable experience in testing response times and validating the effectiveness of their emergency procedures.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rick Hughes, the Nightshift Supervisor at Dove Holes, led the drill, which involved two casualty rescues from the rail load-out. The scenario included one unconscious dummy casualty in the rail shuttle and one live casualty with broken legs on the walkway. The Rail operative discovered the casualties and radioed for first aiders, who then called 999. Derbyshire Fire and Rescue performed a rope rescue, administered CPR to the unconscious casualty, and relocated both casualties to a safe space<\/p>\n\n<p>The drill also tested various emergency procedures, including radio messages, first aid, and working at height. The exercise highlighted several positive aspects, such as excellent communication with incoming emergency services using pick-ups and weighbridge staff, a swift response from on-site first aiders, and effective handover to emergency services. However, it also identified areas for improvement, including radio etiquette during emergencies, managing production and heavy traffic during emergency service arrivals, and enhancing first aid training.<\/p>\n\n<p>The joint exercise was a perfect opportunity for Rick, who also serves as a retained firefighter for Derbyshire Fire and Rescue, to bridge his roles and facilitate collaboration. The drill not only benefited Cemex but also provided valuable training for DFRS, particularly given the presence of several quarries in the area, which pose unique risks to the service.<\/p>\n\n<p>The drill concluded with a debriefing session where both organisations reviewed the exercise from start to finish, discussed what went well, and identified areas for improvement. The debriefing followed the IIMARCH framework, covering Information, Intent, Method, Administration, Risk assessment, Communication, and Humanitarian Issues<\/p>\n\n<p>Congratulations to everyone involved. Overall, the joint emergency drill was a resounding success, demonstrating the importance of preparedness, coordination, and continuous learning in ensuring the safety and well-being of all involved.<\/p>"

Of the total amount of waste collected, Cemex has repurposed more than 460 tons as alternative fuels at its Assiut Cement Plant, supporting its circularity strategy.<\/p>\n\n<p>The partnership has also enabled VeryNile to expand its operations, including launching its Assiut Hub in Cemex Egypt\u2019s operational hometown. Through this, more than 360 new job opportunities were created, including for local fishing communities, increasing the capacity for waste collection from the Nile.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the partnership is helping to foster community and sustainable development through the creation of social and educational initiatives. In 2023, Cemex\u2019s Assiut Cement Football Club launched a new branch of its academy on Qursaya Island in Cairo, providing young people with an opportunity to play sports and nurture their skills in a professional and safe environment with advanced facilities, rigorous training programmes and experienced coaches.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result of this collaborative effort, Cemex was included in Fortune's 2024 Change the World list, ranking 24th out of 52 companies.

        "Body": "<p>Located on rue Saint-Dominique in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, the development involved rehabilitating and restructuring three buildings of the Îlot Saint-Germain into housing and facilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>The facilities part of the scheme included the creation of a gymnasium-garden within a complex of 254 rehabilitated housing units, a nursery with 68 cradles, and a 600 m² garden. The gymnasium is equipped with a 60-seat grandstand and a 300 m² multi-sport hall. The gymnasium's sleek architecture highlights the garden placed on a glazed band of the building. Only concrete screens stripe an entirely white volume, allowing natural light to illuminate a play area, winter gardens, and a dance hall. A planted patio connects the different elements of the project.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the architect required ultra-white concrete, Cemex's Parisian production units at Port Victor and Tolbiac expertly met the expectations imposed by this site, both in terms of the rigor of concrete production and the technicality of the formulas. Cemex supplied 2,500 m³ of concrete for this project, including 1,500 m³ of architectural and self-placing concrete based on white cement mixed with white and beige pigment. These concretes were respectively intended for the realisation of the screens and walls of the nursery, and the construction of the walls of the sports facilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex also advised and provided pumping services to facilitate the implementation of the concrete. The company GTM carried out meticulous work in implementing this concrete in particularly complex, narrow, and hard-to-reach formwork.<\/p>\n\n<p>All these constraints required a very fluid, stable, and consistently high-quality concrete formula, a challenge successfully met by Cemex's quality and production services. Well before the start of the site, significant specification work had taken place, and several samples were submitted to the architect until the ideal formula was validated.<\/p>\n\n<p>This development was recognised during the 4th edition of the Trophée Béton Pro (Trophies concrete Pro), which rewards architectural projects using concrete in an innovative, sustainable, and aesthetic way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Michel Andre, VP of Materials for Western Europe said: \u201c\"The successful completion of this project highlights the exceptional collaboration and dedication of our teams across various departments, including prescription, commercial, quality, production, delivery, and handling. Our ability to meet the stringent requirements of the Îlot Saint-Germain development with our ultra-white concrete is a testament to Cemex's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about Cemex, visit <a href=\"http://www.cemex.co.uk\">www.cemex.co.uk<\/a><\/p>"

It\u2019s important that foundation industries such as ours, which play a vital role in supporting wider economic growth and provide local employment opportunities are recognised for the support we provide to the economic growth across other many other sectors such as housebuilding, construction, infrastructure, clean energy and advanced manufacturing.\u201d<\/p>"

Simple actions have started to have a big impact, such as separating office waste to ease reprocessing, eliminating paper coffee cups and paper towels and minimising printing and copying with the attendant reductions in consumables.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis builds on the considerable efforts already taking place in our wider operation to ensure sustainable resource use. In the last year alone, we reduced and repurposed 28 million tonnes of waste across our global operations, some of which has been incorporated into alternative fuels used at our cement plants. We are excited to see how the contributions of our office-based teams can improve this further!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Most recently, Cemex\u2019s UK Head Office in Coventry, West Midlands became the first facility in its EMEA operations to become a zero-waste-to-landfill site, following almost three years of reducing waste generation and energy consumption.

The global building materials provider has a proud heritage in the UK, tracing its origins back to a small family business formed in 1826 who initially started producing lime mortar at a site in Rugby, Warwickshire, where the organisation is still based today.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex currently operates more than 20 quarries, 2 cement plants, 90 concrete mixing plants and a supply chain network boasting a significant logistical capability with a fleet of modern vehicles, locomotives and vessels that supports the delivery of essential building and construction materials throughout the UK by road, rail, river and sea.<\/p>"

Following their initial success, mixers have since been deployed across France, Poland, the Czech Republic and Spain, with Germany further expanding its own EV fleet, acquiring seven new trucks so far this year.<br />\nCemex\u2019s electric mixer fleet can reduce carbon emissions by up to 100% while also offering exceptionally low noise levels. Alongside the initial sustainability benefits, this quiet operation provides significant advantages to local communities and other road users, particularly in urban environments where logistical activities may occur. Furthermore, these trucks are equipped with modern safety features and can carry similar amounts of materials to those of a conventional mixer.&nbsp;<br />\nMatthew Wild, EMEA VP for Supply Chain and Procurement, said, \u201cTransport is one of the key areas where Cemex strives to reduce its CO2 emissions, which is why we are investing in and implementing electric mixers across our EMEA operations. These trucks incorporate renewable energy sources, which enables us to provide more sustainable solutions for the transportation of ready-mix materials while also being a better neighbour and fellow road user.\u201d<br />\nThe adoption of renewable energy sources forms a key part of Cemex\u2019s Future in Action strategy, which focuses on the decarbonisation of its global operations through developing and integrating more sustainable products and technologies, to become a Net-Zero CO2 company by 2050.<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland<\/p>\n\n<p>[ENDS]<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Summary": "Cemex in Central Europe Materials is developing its focus on renewable energy, providing both environmental and financial benefits. Since 2023, the company's solar installations in these locations have already generated 2 GWh of energy - enough to power 350 households for one year.\nFurther photovoltaic farms are already under construction at Cemex\u2019s Central Europe Materials plants. Investments in renewable energy confirm the company's commitment to the \"Future in Action\" strategy, which aims to mitigate climate change.",

        "Body": "<p>Cemex is consistently expanding its portfolio of photovoltaic farms in Central Europe Materials, which reduces our company\u2019s reliance on traditional energy methods and provides a long-term return on investment by saving on energy costs. One of the main benefits is also conducting business in accordance with environmental conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, Cemex plants in this area operate five photovoltaic farms - four of them are in Germany and one in Pruszków near Warsaw. Soon, there will be a total of nine such farms in Poland. New installations will be also launched on the premises of cement plants and concrete plants in Mysłowice, Warsaw, Lublin, Szczecin, Gdańsk, and at the mine in Mirowo quarry under an agreement with EDP Energia Polska, which is part of the European leader in solar solutions, photovoltaic installations will be built, the total capacity of which will exceed 14 MWp.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore in Berlin (Germany) Cemex will install additional 30 kWp at a Ready-Mix-Plant powering not only the batching plant but also the electric mixer fleet with solar energy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Existing farms already supply Cemex plants in Central Europe Materials with 128,4MWh of energy per month. Once the new installations are up and running, this will amount to as much as 291,4 MWh.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the era of ongoing climate change, we need investments that will allow our societies to develop in a more sustainable manner while also increasing our company\u2019s efficiency. Obtaining energy from renewable sources, which reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and cuts our use of traditional energy methods, is key in this context. Cemex consistently increases the share of renewable energy in its energy mix. Thanks to this, we can expand our offer of lower-emission products, supporting customers in reducing the carbon footprint of their investments - says Patryk Czaplewski, Director of Operational Excellence for Central Europe at Cemex.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first Cemex photovoltaic farms in Central Europe were launched in 2022in Germany. It is in this country that Cemex has its largest solar installation in the region. The floating photovoltaic farm on the reservoir in the Immelborn gravel pit (near Erfurt) has a capacity of 750 kWp and produces approximately 830 MWh of energy per year.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first photovoltaic farm on the premises of the Polish Cemex plants was built four years ago at the ready-mix concrete plant in Pruszków. 124 panels have a total capacity of 50 kWp, and the annual energy production from this installation meets 20% of the plant's demand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Investments in photovoltaics are not the only activities of Cemex in the area of renewable energy. In this context, the contract with the Norwegian company Statkraft is also worth noting, which at the beginning of 2025 began to supply Polish Cemex plants with energy from domestic wind and photovoltaic farms. The contract with Statkraft will be valid for 8 years, securing 30% of Cemex Polska's energy needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>## Ends ##<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:<br />\nCemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% alternative fuel use<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30%<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is an industry leading global construction materials and solutions company that is building a better future safely through more sustainable products and solutions.
