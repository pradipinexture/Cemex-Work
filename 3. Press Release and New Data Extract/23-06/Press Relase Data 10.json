        "Body": "<p>Grazing is essential in maintaining the low nutrient levels required by the plant species present in this beautiful habitat. The random grazing pattern of livestock creates vital structure within the grassland. This creates micro habitats, each of which have their own microclimate - more micro habitats mean more insects, and more insects, mean more birds and mammals. The structure of a habitat with its lumps and bumps, tall bits and short, is the foundation to increasing biodiversity on our sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>The restoration of our quarries is a vital part of our dedicated sustainability strategy Future in Action. We work closely with the RSPB to ensure Biodiversity Management Plans are in place across our UK quarries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mark Gough, Quarry Manager at Kensworth quarry, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that when our work is finished at the quarry, the land is restored to a high standard so it can a habitat for many diverse wildlife and plant species. We\u2019ve been keen to introduce sheep and I\u2019m delighted that they have now arrived with us. We\u2019re excited to see how they can positively impact the biodiversity of the restored areas and the habitat available \u2013 and they certainly help make the landscape even more picturesque!\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>This week, the UKTBC visited a global leader in cement manufacturing, and the UK\u2019s largest Mexican investor, Cemex, to gather evidence on the proposed UK carbon border tax.<br />\nCemex, who generate approximately £775 million in annual sales and employ around 2,000 people across the UK, cautioned that without an equivalent to the EU\u2019s schemes being introduced in a timely manner, UK industries will be at a disadvantage, competing with cheaper goods produced to lower environmental standards flooding the UK market while facing less incentive themselves to invest the significant sums required to decarbonise.<br />\nStrengthening the case for the UK system to align with the EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) of its largest market, Cemex also warned divergent schemes between the UK and its largest market could result in a duplication of compliance requirements, further increasing costs.<br />\nIn May 2023 the UKTBC, produced a report with 114 recommendations which included mutually beneficial alignment with the EU in areas such as this.&nbsp;<br />\nThe potential impact of regulatory divergence has only gained salience after other foreign firms divested from the UK following increased costs and administrative burden from Brexit and the threat of further UK-EU divergence. In October, Swedish-based SKF moved its ball bearing manufacturing factory from Luton to Poland to &nbsp;\u201csecure the long-term competitiveness on the European markets.\u201d<br />\nMartin Casey, Director Public Affairs, Communications &amp; Social Impact for Cemex EMEA, said,&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe lack of a common carbon adjustment system with the UK\u2019s largest market disincentives investment needed for decarbonisation, while the threat of further divergence could put firms based here at a competitive disadvantage due to increased costs and other compliance requirements.<br />\n\u201cBy pledging to align our CBAM with the EU\u2019s, the government will unlock the green potential, restoring the competitiveness of UK industry and putting itself in a position where it can continue to lead on combating climate change.\u201d<br />\nPeter Norris, Co-convener of the UK Trade and Business Commission and Chair of the Virgin Group said,<br />\n\u201cThere is no point committing to decarbonisation in the UK, if we continue to cheat the system by importing carbon intensive products from abroad.<br />\n\u201cIf the Government wants to regain the confidence of essential green investors, unnerved by recent u-turns on net-zero, they will prioritise the implementation of a carbon border tax which is fully aligned with the EU\u2019s scheme.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>ENDS<br />\n<br />\nNotes to Editors<\/strong><br />\nThe UK Trade and Business Commission brings together MPs from across Westminster and from all four nations of the UK, along with business leaders and expert economists to provide independent scrutiny of the UK\u2019s trade deals and provide recommendations to the Government.<br />\nThe Commission has published 114 recommendations informed by more than 80 hrs of live testimony featuring 234 witnesses and written evidence from more than 200 organisations. The recommendations &nbsp;include:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A UK Board of Trade: An independent government agency to act for the Department for Trade and Business as the OBR does for the Treasury, ensuring that trade policy is independently assessed.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Beneficial alignment: Boost UK economic growth by maintaining regulatory alignment with the EU where beneficial; outside of the Single Market and Customs Union.

        "Body": "<p>This is the latest sustainable development from the global building materials supplier, which includes a focus on the circular economy in its dedicated climate action strategy; Future in Action.&nbsp;<br />\nRUBBERMIX ASPHALT utilises crumb rubber, a material made from shredded waste tyres that is also used for football pitches and softplay floors. It therefore enables end-of-life tyres to be recycled, while creating new roads and new life within the tyres.<br />\nRUBBERMIX ASPHALT is perfect for both local authorities and housebuilders, as it can be incorporated into mixes for highway maintenance and newly constructed roads and pavements, while providing the same quality control and consistent product performance as a standard asphalt.<br />\nScott Jones, Director of Asphalt and Paving Solutions for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cThe UK generates over 486,000 tonnes of used tyres each year and CEMEX has identified an opportunity to incorporate some of these into its existing asphalt mixes thanks to RUBBERMIX ASPHALT, with the potential to recycle up to 500 tyres per kilometre of road.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX believes a circular economy is essential for environmental sustainability. By transforming waste materials into invaluable solutions, carbon emissions are reduced along with other environmental benefits. &nbsp;RUBBERMIX ASPHALT can also be combined with our VIALOW range of lower carbon asphalts to further increase the sustainability of a project.\u201d<br />\nThe circular economy is a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. Earlier this year, it was added as one of the pillars of CEMEX\u2019s global sustainability strategy, Future in Action. &nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s climate action strategy aims to lead the way in the construction industry and as part of this effort CEMEX Urbanisation Solutions is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of modern urbanisation.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland<br />\nFor more information, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/rubbermix-asphalt\">www.cemex.co.uk/rubbermix-asphalt<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Display Title": "Cemex trials unique electric-powered discharge equipment to cut emissions and increase vehicle longevity",
        "Body": "<p>The system, the brainchild of a Cemex employee, has been trialled in Cemex\u2019s UK cement operation, where it has performed effortlessly. Not only has the use of electricity to power the discharge equipment cut emissions, but it has enabled a faster turnaround and significantly quieter delivery. Longer-term, vehicle wear and tear are also reduced.<br />\nThe benefit to the environment of incorporating this equipment into a commercial fleet is considerable; the trial has demonstrated a potential saving of over 4000kg of CO2 in a year, per vehicle using the system, as well as 330 gallons of fuel.&nbsp;<br />\nMatthew Wild, Vice President of Supply Chain and Procurement for Cemex EMEA, commented: \u201cWe have been very impressed with the results of the initial trial of the electric discharge equipment in our cement business. Every single delivery that uses this system to discharge cement, rather than the tanker\u2019s own fuel, saves 13.5kg of CO2; if this equipment was used across our fleet over a full year the difference to our supply chain emissions would be considerable.\u201d<br />\nThe idea for this new discharge equipment came from Nigel Ponton, National Fleet Engineer for the UK business. He worked with supplier Gardner Denver to create the system, which is mounted onto the tractor unit and simply requires three-phase connection to pressurise the tank and allow discharge to silo. This means no additional equipment or investment is needed at the customer\u2019s site.<br />\nMatthew added: \u201cWe believe that every member of our workforce plays a role in ensuring we reach our goal of operating as a net zero company by 2050. The development and trial of this idea demonstrates that nurturing and investing into innovation in your business helps achieve your strategic priorities. Following the successful results of this trial, we are exploring incorporating it across our wider fleet, while also looking at land-based units which can be housed at site.\u201d<br />\nCemex believes that true carbon neutrality can only be achieved by encouraging innovation and discovering breakthrough technologies.

The call is led by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership (Clean Hydrogen JU), the body that oversees EU funding and R&amp;I activities related to hydrogen, with the objective of supporting the EU Green Deal and Hydrogen Strategy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Europe currently produces 300 million tonnes of waste with the potential to produce over 30 million tons of green hydrogen. It is this potential that HYIELD aims to unlock. During the four-year project, novel technologies and processes will be integrated to efficiently and robustly convert biogenic waste streams into high purity green hydrogen at a very competitive cost, to demonstrate its application to help decarbonise different sectors, including shipping, aviation and energy intensive industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The demonstration scale waste-to-hydrogen plant will be trialled at Cemex\u2019s Alcanar cement factory in Spain. During the project, the plant is expected to process over 2,000t of waste and produce nearly 400t of green hydrogen which will be proved for different industry uses such as clean fuels, fertilizers production and others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sergio Menendez, President of Cemex EMEA, commented: \u201cAs part of its drive to reaching net zero by 2050, Cemex is committed to partnering with like-minded organisations to explore the very latest innovations in more sustainable technology that can support the cement production process. We are proud to provide one of our cement plants in Spain as the location for the HYIELD trial and excited to see the outcomes from this R&amp;D project.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Alongside Cemex, the HYIELD project consortium is under the coordination of MAGTEL and made up of other two key portfolio companies; WtEnergy Advanced Solutions and Synhelion; Spanish partners H2SITE, VEOLIA, ENAGAS, EURECAT, CETAQUA, Inveniam Group, CISC and La Farga; along with other partners from across Europe; MINCATEC, SINTEF, ARISTENG and ArcelorMittal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Senior officials of HYIELD, said: \u201cWe are delighted to be a participant of this impactful R&amp;D project that brings together a wide range of skills and experience from across research, tech, energy and heavy industry. We hope the project can open a new low-cost pathway for clean green hydrogen production in Europe, as well as creating new opportunities for waste valorisation and job creation\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>The consortium brings to the project experience in waste management, hydrogen production and thermo-chemical processes to address this challenge.

Following the trial\u2019s success, the technology has since been implemented in its plant based in Rugby, UK, with the Alicante, Spain site due to install imminently.<\/p>\n\n<p>The technology was supplied by German manufacturer Linde Material Handling. Its features include a Reverse Assist Camera for forklifts, which detects pedestrians behind reversing forklifts. In the event of danger, the technology will alert the driver and automatically reduce the speed of the forklift. Linde will also implement its \u201cSafety Guard System\u201d at hall gates of buildings where forklifts can be driven; these project warnings signs to make pedestrians and other forklift operators aware that a vehicle is entering the facility.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dietmar Voetsch, Director of Admixtures Europe, said: \u201cAt Cemex, we are always looking for new processes and innovations to ensure safety in our workplaces. Linde\u2019s Safety Guard System and Reverse Assist Camera are ideal solutions for occupational safety in our Admixtures plants; we were immediately convinced by the technology and the feedback we\u2019ve received from employees who have used it has been extremely positive.

Yet only half of the UK\u2019s 10 cement plants are currently part of a cluster and some, like Rugby, are too isolated from other industry to be part of a cluster.&nbsp;<br />\nDecarbonisation at dispersed plants is just as vital as those within clusters if the West Midlands, and the UK more widely, is to meet its net zero ambitions.&nbsp;<br />\nLord Callanan, Minister for Energy Efficiency and Green Finance, said: \u201cWe have a strong cement industry here in the UK which is vital to our infrastructure, housing and urban regeneration. The Government has recently published its blueprint for a carbon capture industry, to assist important sectors such as cement manufacturing to reach net zero while supporting our construction needs. It was excellent to hear from leaders here in Rugby, a cement heartland in its own right, about the impact of this work and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with UK cement producers.\u201d<br />\nMartin Casey, Director Public Affairs, Communications &amp; Social Impact commented: \u201cWe were proud to welcome Lord Callanan to our Rugby Cement Plant, which plays a vital role in both the local economy and the wider national construction industry. Cement is a vital component in infrastructure such as hospitals, bridges, schools and houses so we must work together with Government to ensure that it can continue to be produced into the long term, while ensuring the West Midlands and UK meets its net zero targets.\u201d<br />\nCemex\u2019s Rugby Cement Plant has pioneered the use of alternative fuels, including a multimillion-pound investment in 2022 to eliminate fossil fuel use in favour of waste derived alternatives, a key part of the firm\u2019s global efforts to decarboniSe its operations and achieve net-zero CO2 cement and concrete by 2050.<br />\n-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of circular materials per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<br />\nCemex R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>The next stage sees Cemex and partners building a demonstrator of a smart shore power system with battery energy storage for vessels alongside. This system incorporates renewable energy to provide constant power whist simulating fluctuating power demands and delivers real world emissions savings.<br />\nFollowing the success of initial paper-based feasibility studies, Cemex is working in partnership with University of Warwick and advanced system integrator, iconsys, to deliver an intelligently managed shore power system demonstrator, specifically tailored to understand self-discharging commercial vessel\u2019s demanding electrical load fluctuations. It will incorporate battery energy storage and solar photovoltaic energy generation, plus integrated hardware-in-the-loop simulation to both virtually expand the capability of the system and validate modelling software predictions.<br />\nThe demonstrator will deliver constant power to the vessel alongside, after discharge at 250kW, whilst simulating the full dynamic discharge cycle (1.5MW) alongside the berth. The model enables the innovative, dynamic, multi-objective energy management system to maximise the use of lower-carbon electricity, minimising the use of engines alongside.<br />\nThis stage of the project will take place at Cemex\u2019s wharf in Shoreham, Brighton &amp; Hove, which will better allow Cemex to manage the impact of the demonstrator on its operations. Additionally, it aligns with Shoreham Port\u2019s wider sustainability goals and efforts to create a credible and measurable Local Industrial Decarbonisation Plan.&nbsp;<br />\nWork will start on this stage of the project in April, with 12 months allowed for installation and demonstration of the system to be completed and the results shared with stakeholders from the industry and Department for Transport.&nbsp;<br />\nLaurence Dagley, Operational Excellence and Business Development Director for Cemex West Europe materials commented: \u201cOur initial feasibility study for this shore power system identified an opportunity to save a significant amount of CO2 during each dredger discharge, while also improving local air quality at the port itself. We are therefore pleased to have received this funding to progress to the next stage of the project and undertake on-site demonstration.<br />\n\u201cThe timings for this stage are tight but the potential benefits are considerable, as it will allow us to gain real experience of all the hardware, in a real environment, whilst being able to study full scale operation and quantify the benefits. Utilising the Cemex Go Innovation, already the newest and most advanced aggregates dredger in the industry, this will be the first dredger in the UK to be shore powered and marks an exciting progression in our efforts to decarbonise.\u201d<br />\nJordan Tassell, Head of Marine &amp; Ports for iconsys, commented: \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity to progress towards a demonstration of the smart shore power system, a cutting-edge solution that goes beyond the standard. The aim is to offer key functionality and benefits that will support uptake within the maritime sector and drive the future of vessel connectivity.<br />\n\u201ciconsys is driven by the ambition to develop our specialised skillset in this domain, leveraging this demonstration project as a strategic platform. Our commitment is not just limited to system integration; we aim to detail, design, and manufacture a solution that sets a benchmark in efficiency and reliability. This venture aligns with our broader vision of pushing the boundaries of innovation and playing a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of smart, connected ports and vessels.\"<br />\nDr Andrew McGordon, Reader in the Energy Applications Group at WMG, University of Warwick commented \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate the learnings form the feasibility study using an innovative mix of real and virtual hardware, to understand the operational challenges of decarbonising this sector whilst developing state of the art energy management strategies to maximise CO2 emissions savings.\u201d<br />\nThis project is part of the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean-maritime-demonstration-competition-cmdc\"> Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition Round 4 (CMDC4)<\/a>, funded by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) and delivered by Innovate UK.

        "Body": "<p>In our European cement operations, we have already reduced our CO2 intensity by nearly 45% compared to 1990 and have an ambitious plan to reach 55% reduction by 2030, in line with the EU\u2019s \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 aspirations. Cemex is investing significantly in solutions to reduce CO2 emissions to the extent that is currently technically possible. However, the production of cement inevitably gives rise to some CO2 emissions, including biogenic. Therefore, Cemex &nbsp;requires the completion of the policy landscape for carbon management to fully decarbonise its operations and make fast investment decisions.<br />\nCommenting on the Communication, Martin Casey, Director Communications, Public Affairs &amp; Social Impact for Cemex EMEA, says: \u201cThe strategy is comprehensive and outlines relevant fields of action but what is essential now is a timely implementation. For companies to move forward, the regulatory framework regarding CCU/S along with carbon accounting and removals must be completed as a matter of the utmost urgency. The cement plant of 2030 is planned and designed today.\u201d<br />\nExploiting the full potential of biogenic emissions from cement production&nbsp;<br />\nSignificantly increasing the share of alternative fuels in the cement plants\u2019 fuel mixes in the coming decade is an integral part of Cemex\u2019s decarbonisation strategy. As a result, Cemex\u2019s cement plants are a reliable source of emissions from more sustainable biomass and contribute to carbon removals in case of permanent storage.&nbsp;<br />\nCemex therefore appreciates that permanent storage of biogenic CO2 from industry has been recognised as one of the major pathways of industrial carbon management in the EU and both supports and advocates for the integration of scientifically sound industrial carbon removal from various sources and technologies into the EU-ETS.<br />\nDevelopment of a dense European CO2 transport and storage infrastructure to reduce costs.<br />\nThe development of CO2 transport infrastructure has been rightly identified as a priority by the European Commission. Operational expenditures for CCS will be driven by transportation and storage costs to a significant extent. To render the industry\u2019s transformation economically viable, the European Union and its Member States should develop a dense and readily accessible network of CO2 pipelines, connecting storage sites to both industrial hubs and dispersed industrial sites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Summary": "Munich, Germany, and Monterrey, Mexico, 15.02.2024 \u2013 Cemex and Orcan Energy announced today a large-scale partnership to decarbonize cement production through waste heat recovery. Building on the initial waste heat recovery collaboration at the cement plant in Rüdersdorf, Germany, the partners will now start to exploit Orcan Energy\u2019s flexible and modular technology for Cemex globally. The goal of this multi-site portfolio approach is to convert large waste heat volumes into clean energy, profitably reducing carbon emissions for Cemex overall.",

        "Body": "<p>The global construction materials company Cemex and Orcan Energy AG, the leading cleantech company turning waste heat into clean electricity, will analyze the scale-up of the heat-to-power solutions pioneered by Orcan Energy in parallel at several Cemex plants to capitalize on the benefits resulting from a portfolio of installations. The representative findings will be collected to draw a holistic picture for an upcoming global waste heat recovery program. The portfolio approach with detailed multi-site data collection allows the partners to efficiently and quickly deploy Orcan Energy\u2019s modular applications at scale in the second phase of the collaboration.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sergio Menéndez, President of Cemex Europe, Middle East, Africa &amp; Asia, said: \u201cWe already have an initial collaboration with Orcan. Based on the modularity of their solution, Orcan offers the flexibility of both installation and contracts. Thanks to this crucial flexibility, we can adapt to any upcoming changes in our plants. The approach enables us to reduce carbon emissions right now without limiting ourselves in implementing any future technologies such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage. This partnership will help us achieve our sustainability targets and contribute to our aim to use all available heat.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Andreas Sichert, CEO of Orcan Energy, said: \u201cWe are looking forward to entering this large-scale decarbonization partnership with Cemex after our initial cooperation in Germany. This step is a testament to Cemex\u2019s forward-looking strategy and the company\u2019s commitment to achieving net zero. For Orcan Energy, this is another milestone in scaling the business internationally with global enterprises. We are proud to be the partner of choice for the cement industry. Our large footprint across the industry shows the economic capability and the technical excellence of our modular and flexible solution, especially in view of uncertain future economic and regulative developments.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2021, Cemex and Orcan Energy started their first joint project in Rüdersdorf, Germany, near Berlin, with the installation of six waste heat recovery modules which could produce up to 8,000 megawatt hours per year, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 3,000 tons. Following this ongoing cooperation, the companies decided to enter a large-scale decarbonization partnership, exploring the deployment of waste heat recovery solutions in several further sites, multiplying today\u2019s electricity savings and CO2 reductions.<\/p>\n\n<p>In industrial production, usually 30-60% of the energy is lost in the form of heat. Cement production is particularly energy and CO2-intensive. Therefore, the cement industry is actively searching for ways to reduce carbon emissions and utilize its waste heat. Modular waste heat recovery technology is a proven and commercially viable energy efficiency solution that can be flexibly installed in several applications. The heat-to-power modules can be placed at the pre-heater as well as the clinker cooler. Both heat sources can either be utilized combined or separately. If the waste heat availability changes over time, the modules can be redeployed at other waste heat sources and sites or even be returned. Thanks to this flexibility, various other heat users can be included in the future \u2013 the heat extraction will retain its value in any event.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About Orcan Energy<\/p>\n\n<p>Orcan Energy AG develops, produces, distributes and finances energy modules for the conversion of waste heat into clean and cheap electricity and constructs them on a turnkey basis, including the installation required for waste heat extraction. Orcan Energy's products tap into the enormous global waste heat potential and enable customers to save CO2 emissions and costs at the same time. Orcan Energy unlocks the energy potential of unused heat sources based on second-generation Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology. By massively downsizing the established technology and developing a modular solution, Orcan Energy is turning small and medium-sized waste heat sources, as well as lower temperatures into economically viable options for the first time. As a result, the modules can be installed directly wherever excess heat is generated, for example in industrial processes, in engines, on ships or even in geothermal plants. Orcan Energy's solutions are already helping companies in the cement, oil and gas, power generation, and marine sectors to achieve their sustainability goals, reduce costs and comply with future regulations. Thanks to flexible financing models, companies can save cash-flow-positive electricity or fuel costs with waste heat power generation from day one. Orcan Energy has already marketed more than 650 modules with over 7 million operating hours internationally. The company has more than 60 employees and is headquartered in Munich, Germany.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about the company, its products and applications, visit <a href=\"about:blank\">www.orcan-energy.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.

A major part of the upgrade work has included the replacement of four conveyor units, dating back to before the 1960s. &nbsp;In addition, some of the quarry\u2019s traditional ladders have been replaced with modern stairways to increase accessibility and safety around the plant.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>David Hakes, Senior Project Manager, Cemex, comments: \u201cThe refurbishment at Raynes Quarry was conducted during a four week production shutdown. &nbsp;Sales were maintained by road and sea during the works and underpinned by excellent communication and co-ordination between Supply chain, Operations and Engineering teams over several months of planning. Critically, the works were completed safely with up to 12 contractors on site at the same time.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Mick Ripley, Cemex Raynes Quarry Manager, added: \u201cThe conveyors at Raynes Quarry had reached the end of their serviceable life and needed to be replaced. One of the conveyors removed we believe is more than 60 years old and representative of the rich history and longevity of production at the site as well as the quality of the plant equipment and machinery at Cemex, which is built to last. Today\u2019s modern day replacements will be no different in terms of the exacting standards and high performance specification for resilience and endurance.\u201d<br />\nContractors for the works at Raynes Quarry included Bennetts Conveyors, PCS Electrical and Axon Electrical. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information www.cemex.co.uk<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>The Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund awarded Cemex Croatia contracts for the implementation of three projects of energy production from renewable sources co-financed by the EU\u2019s Modernization Fund. Cemex will therefore build new solar power plants at Sv. Juraj cement plant in Kaštel Sućurac, Sv. Kajo cement plant in Solin and the Podsused production facility in Zagreb, with a total value of over 5 million euros out of which approximately 3 million is co-financed by the EU.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex will cover the roofs of these plants and buildings with solar power plants with a total installed capacity of 6.34 MW. At the Sv. Juraj plant, the plan is to add photovoltaic systems with an installed power of 3.79 MW worth 3 million euros, while on the roofs of the Sv. Kajo plant photovoltaic systems with an installed power of 2.14 MW worth 1.7 million euros will be fitted. Both of these investments were co-financed from the Modernization Fund to the amount of 60 percent. Photovoltaic systems with an installed capacity of 0.41 MW will be set on the Podsused production facility, and 50 percent of the project's value of approximately 318,000 euros is also co-financed by European means.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"The savings that these measures will bring to us in terms of energy consumption will increase the efficiency of our production and reduce emissions from our operations and confirm our status as a manufacturing company that takes its obligations in terms of energy and thus climate efficiency very seriously. These are just some of the projects we are planning to achieve our climate goals\", said Marijan Zekić, Cemex's Croatia project and quality assurance manager.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>By increasing the production of energy from renewable sources, the company invests new funds in energy efficiency and takes a new step towards achieving the goal of increasing the use of lower carbon energy in its production. Namely, the global goal of Cemex's climate program Future in Action is to become a company with net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All activities carried out are aimed at achieving the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which include 47 percent lower CO2 emissions per ton of cement material and 35 percent less carbon content in concrete globally by 2030, as well as achieving a level of lower carbon energy use of 65 percent of electricity consumption.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Following the goals of our decarbonisation program, at Cemex we invest not only in energy efficiency projects, but also in different types of technologies that will ensure more climate-efficient production. Also, an important goal of ours is the development of lower-carbon, and ultimately carbon-neutral cement, concrete, aggregates and admixtures, thus rounding off our approach to creating the future of construction with less CO2 emissions throughout the value chain,\" said Cemex Croatia CEO Alen Voloder.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a major investment cycle focused on energy efficiency, Cemex Croatia has invested significant funds in the modernisation of its facilities in the last few years. The last completed project of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources worth approximately 3 million euros in Sv.

        "Body": "<p>During this time both primary and secondary schools in the Hatfield area have participated in an educational programme designed to help students learn more about why we quarry and the lifecycle of a quarry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The partnership has brought immersive educational experiences to over 2,000 children, fostering a deeper understanding of quarrying, local industry, wildlife conservation, and geology. The programme for all schools involved includes a visit to Hatfield Quarry and Amwell Nature Reserve, as well as two classroom sessions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Visits to our quarry give children the opportunity to learn about the industry, through exploring and comparing a working quarry to a quarry which has been restored as a nature reserve. Activities during these sessions include fossil making, bird watching, sketching and role playing and debates. The activities allow the children to learn about the process of quarrying, the impact of this industry on local wildlife and gain knowledge about local geology and the formation of fossils. Over the years, the children have taken great interest in learning about their local area and this offer to schools has always been welcomed, being a great way of meeting many requirements of the National Curriculum.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2024, Groundwork East have planned this programme with six more local schools: Birchwood Avenue Primary, Howe Dell Primary, Oak View Primary, Green Lanes Primary, St Philip Howard Primary and Onslow St Audrey Secondary School. The students are looking forward to the visits and developing their knowledge.<\/p>"

The company intends to increase this number to 40% in the medium term by increasing the growth capex and investing divestment proceeds to the region.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex also plans to continue leveraging its fastest-growing business, Urbanization Solutions. First incorporated as a core business in 2020, Urbanization Solutions reached US$2.5 billion in sales and US$300 million in EBITDA in 2023, accounting for 9% of consolidated EBITDA.

Over the past four years, Cemex Europe\u2019s EBITDA grew at a 7% compounded annual growth rate, with approximately a 1 percentage point margin expansion, accompanied by a 17% reduction in CO2 emissions.

        "Body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Vialayer is an enhanced Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) surface course which has been specially developed to provide an advanced high grade solution against the main causes of road defects in urban environments.&nbsp; Using a combination of a selected aggregate grading and a high volume of Polymer Modified Bitumen Vialayer can help local authorities to reduce the frequency and cost of maintenance needed for pavements, and highly trafficked roads. It also offers greater flexibility allowing it to absorb the stresses of urban traffic and withstand the impact of slow, heavy-moving vehicles like buses in bus lanes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Scott Jones, Director of Asphalt, Cemex UK said: \u201cWith Vialayer we have worked hard to provide a solution to help local authorities manage their ever increasing maintenance costs. According to a recent Government report, road maintenance has dropped to the lowest level in five years, putting local councils under a tremendous amount of pressure to reduce spending and allocate resources efficiently. With less money available to carry out road maintenance, councils must be confident in the materials they use for projects, without causing greater expenses in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany urban streets were built for much lower traffic volumes than they experience today, with limited capacity for increased thickness. Often when maintenance work is carried out, it creates trenches which, when overlaid with conventional asphalt mixes, can lead to problems with reflective cracking. This significantly reduces the lifespan of the asphalt surface, causing the same problems to re-occur frequently, often within months of the work being completed. Vialayer offers a highly effective solution to this growing problem. It also exhibits very low noise from the road and tyre interface as a result of the negative textured surface \u2013 which is beneficial in an urban environment. By cutting down the ongoing road maintenance requirements, Vialayer also will contribute to reduced traffic delays for busy towns and streets.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is committed to developing a more sustainable approach to road and highway maintenance and construction, through continued investment into innovation and circularity, by incorporating waste sources from other streams into its materials. In tandem, the company is focussed on the advancement of its portfolio of more sustainable asphalt products and solutions. These demonstrate lower carbon embodiedment, use of recycled materials and increased water conservation to meet customer and environmental demand; ultimately building a better future for everyone.<\/p>\n\n<p>The launch of Vialayer asphalt, follows the introduction of Viaflex SAMI (Stress Alleviating Membrane Interlayer), earlier this year, which is specifically designed for overlays onto concrete, cement bound bases or where movement of underlying pavement layers is likely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Viaflex SAMI offers an extremely flexible asphalt mix designed to absorb stresses caused by natural thermal movement and high trafficking, and sees Cemex continue to broaden its portfolio of Asphalt products and solutions targeted at bringing innovative solutions to everyday challenges faced across the construction, infrastructure and highways industries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both Vialayer and Viaflex SAMI are available as part of Cemex\u2019s Urbanisation Asphalt Solutions portfolio.

As a leader in the construction industry, we look forward to supporting their circular economy journey through this long-term collaboration and showcasing the potential of innovative circular practices within the building materials industry,\u201d said Joe Murphy, Executive of the Business Network at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The United Nations found that in 2021 the buildings and construction sector emitted historic levels of CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately 37% of global CO2 emissions. Incorporating circular economy principles into the built environment can create more sustainable and liveable urban areas, reduce global CO2 emissions from building materials by 38% by 2050, and enhance sector resilience to supply chain disruptions and raw material price volatility.<\/p>\n\n<p>A circular economy helps tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and other global challenges by decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. The Foundation is working to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, that is based on three principles driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s Regenera recovered over 9 million tons of construction and demolition waste (CDEW) in 2023, marking a 5% increase over the prior year. As a result, construction-related waste has been effectively utilized and treated as raw materials for aggregates in concrete production, reintegrating them into the construction value chain and reducing the environmental impact of the industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regenera is part of Future in Action, Cemex's program to achieve sustainable excellence through climate action, circularity, and natural resource management with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Ellen MacArthur Foundation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is an international charity that develops and promotes the circular economy in order to tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution.

        "Summary": "Global building materials solutions supplier Cemex has embarked on an innovative renewable energy project at the company\u2019s new Alrewas Readymix Plant (Pyford Brook) in Staffordshire, UK. The scheme which uses a 90kWh battery, along with solar panels, expects to save 200 tonnes of CO2.",

        "Body": "<p>As part of Cemex\u2019s company-wide climate action programme, \u2018Future in Action\u2019, the Alrewas site installed the hybrid solar unit in a bid to significantly reduce CO2 and the plant\u2019s operational costs. The new facility at Alrewas opened in 2023 without mains electricity which means the site, until recently has been exclusively powered by diesel generators. Keen to reduce CO2 and the reliance on fossil fuels, the Operational Excellence team were quickly able to reduce the night-time diesel generator usage by 68%, once the renewable power units were installed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Steven Coles Operational Excellence Manager, West Europe Materials, comments: \u201cCemex is embracing all forms of new innovations and ideas in the quest to lower our carbon footprint. As our operations transition towards net zero, we are all enjoying the experience of designing and utilising new technology, with batteries and other forms of renewable energy. Cemex\u2019s intensive training with the Renewables Institute has enabled us to skill up in this critical area. It is empowering in itself to have completed several renewable projects over the past year and to now have more exciting projects in the pipeline.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Spencer, VP for Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM, added: \u201cIt is inspiring to witness our Future in Action programme sparking high levels of ingenuity and creativity within our workforce. The renewables installation at Alrewas is attractive in both payback and CO2 reduction, as well as being replicable across other operations that are not able to be connected to the electricity grid. The future here is bright!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result of the success at Alrewas, a second battery and solar unit installation is now planned at Cemex\u2019s Hamer Warren quarry, in the New Forest, Hampshire. The same renewable energy technology will be utilised at Hamer Warren to reduce diesel consumption during the plant\u2019s onsite pumping activities.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the forefront of the circular economy in the construction value chain, Cemex is pioneering ways to increase the use of alternative fuels across its operations as well as waste and residues as alternative raw materials. Providing cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and urbanisation solutions in growing markets around the world, Cemex is powered by a multinational workforce which is focused on delivering a superior customer experience, enabled by digital technologies.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.cemex.com\">www.cemex.com<\/a> &nbsp;<\/p>"

Steve originates from Small Dale and was only too happy to purchase the materials needed which included three used beer barrels from Buxton Brewery which Steve Croft professionally cut in half for us to use as planters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Next step was to plan a dry day to do the work and in early September (2023) Michael Craven led a small team from the night shift to complete the task. At various times of the day different locals turned up to help out or just to show their appreciation which was a great help and made the event feel very worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n<p>After the event Angela was in touch to thank Cemex and Steve from Town and Country. She said the event had \u2018lifted\u2019 the locals into action with garden gates being painted, flowers planted, and grass verges cut to perfection. \u201cYou must come back in spring for photo\u2019s when the bulbs we\u2019ve planted have flowered\u201d she said. And that\u2019s exactly what we did!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>By Liam Perkins, Night Shift Quarry Manager, Dove Holes<\/strong><\/p>"

It\u2019s never too early, my is only five years old.\u201d The school itself is a member of the John Taylor Multi Academy Trust, and serves a wide range of schoolchildren up to seven years old before they go on to junior or primary school.<\/p>\n\n<p>From the school, the visit was overseen by the Headteacher, Mrs Jo Cripps, who said: \u201cWe have had a full day of road safety. We\u2019ve had a truck, we\u2019ve had safety equipment and we\u2019ve had children climbing into the cab. All classes have had a presentation where road safety has been explained to the children. You only have to look at the media to see how many deaths and accidents happen on the roads. Our children are very young so it\u2019s something we find very important here. You hear about accidents with cyclists and a lot of it is because they don\u2019t understand that lorry drivers can\u2019t always see them. So it\u2019s really about an awareness.

This work enables the restoration of biodiversity and the regrowth of native plant species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of our Customer Experience colleagues shared their experiences:<\/p>\n\n<p>Tuesday 18<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;June \u2013 Charter house, Coventry<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had a fantastic day. &nbsp;It was so lovely to be outdoors and doing something worthwhile. &nbsp;It was so nice to meet other people who work at Cemex, as we do not often get to mingle with people in different departments.\u201d \u2013 Sue McNeilis<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe had such a lovely day and really enjoyed it; we didn\u2019t actually want to leave! We were very well looked after by the team there. In the morning we had to clear a large area of brambles, ivy etc, which was so rewarding when we&nbsp;had completed the task. In the afternoon we watered the gardens and made a rockery. It is definitely a hidden gem and I\u2019m so glad I got the opportunity to lend a hand.\u201d \u2013 Hannah Dickson<\/p>\n\n<p>Wednesday 19<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;June \u2013 Westlands Care Home Rugby<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cA thoroughly enjoyable day updating and improving some of the outdoor spaces at Westlands Care Home for the residents. A great team-building exercise and an opportunity to get to know others within Cemex better, who you don\u2019t normally work alongside day to day. The work we put in had clearly visible results \u2013 a very rewarding day for all.\u201d \u2013 Lianne Morgan<\/p>\n\n<p>Thursday 20<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;June \u2013 Charter house, Coventry<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt was a satisfying day giving back to the community volunteering at the Charterhouse. We helped with watering and maintenance of the gardens along with building a TV unit for a 65-inch TV, this took a good chunk of the day shall we say\u2026..! We were shown around the Charterhouse and its gardens, which were steeped with history, we learnt about the history of the charterhouse which was a nice addition to the day.\u201d \u2013 Amanda Walker<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The grant has been awarded as part of a consortium which Cemex will lead, working in partnership with Galliford Try, Sika, Northumbria Water and the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester, and totals around £400k.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mike Higgins, National Technical Manager for Cemex UK, commented that \u201cThe funding further demonstrates our continued commitment to developing more sustainable construction materials and bringing them to market.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is a great example of how partnership working across the construction sector and alongside academic institutions and can drive innovative new approaches that aim to bring about additional benefits for the built environment, as it continues its journey towards a more sustainable future.\u201d<br />\nThe project proposes an innovative approach to decarbonising concrete by integrating micronized limestone and graphene-based admixtures into the concrete mix, targeting the reduction of embodied carbon emissions associated with concrete production.<\/p>\n\n<p>This innovation addresses the challenge by reducing the reliance on Ordinary Portland Cement, which is responsible for a significant portion of concrete's carbon emissions. The use of micronized limestone as a supplementary cementitious material reduces the need for Ordinary Portland Cement, thereby decreasing CO2 emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, incorporating graphene, a novel 2D material, enhances the mechanical properties of the concrete, allowing for the use of higher supplementary cementitious material content without compromising early age strength development.<\/p>\n\n<p>The core innovation lies in the synergy between micronized limestone and graphene. Micronized limestone, with its fine particle size and high surface area, contributes to improved particle packing and hydration reactions in the concrete mix, enhancing strength and durability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The addition of graphene helps to ensure that when used in conjunction with a high supplementary cementitious material content, including micronized limestone, the mix yields lower carbon concrete with traditional or reduced curing time. This extends the use of low carbon supplementary cementitious materials to applications where traditional strength development is needed to meet programme requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>Graphene-enhanced concrete can also be used like standard concrete, which means that no new equipment or training is required in the batching or laying process. As well as benefitting from a reduction in CO2 emissions, this also has the potential to be commercially viable for the customer without additional costs, often associated with new ways of working, being incurred.<\/p>\n\n<p>James Baker, CEO at Graphene@Manchester, added: The bid further strengthens GEIC\u2019s reputation to work with industry and its supply chain for the scale-up and commercialisation of graphene. The potential for graphene-enhanced concrete to significantly reduce CO2 emissions during manufacturing is a major step forward in sustainable construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Higgins goes on to add that, \u201cThe commercial potential of this innovation is substantial, given the urgent need for more sustainable building materials in the face of global climate challenges. Our proposal encompasses a comprehensive plan from laboratory development to real-world application, ensuring the solution is not only technically viable but also commercially viable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/documents/45807659/0/Aggregatres-Tipper-Cemex-logo.jpg/3343eb9a-a74b-911d-9e9e-f7e65191a584?t=1722939146095\" /><\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<br />\nCemex has the primary objective to become a net-zero CO2 company by 2050.

        "Body": "<p>Fortune recognized Cemex\u2019s work with VeryNile in cleaning the Nile River and developing a more sustainable solution for the collected waste. VeryNile is an initiative supported by the Ministry of the Environment in Egypt that develops eco-friendly solutions to remove inorganic waste from the Nile River. Plastics recovered from the river are upcycled, and non-recyclable waste is used as alternative fuel in Cemex\u2019s Assiut cement plant, alleviating pollution issues in the local ecosystem and improving water quality for the community while also providing 150 alternative jobs and income for fishermen and women affected by Nile contamination.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"We are once again honoured by Fortune\u2019s recognition of our sustainable business model, which aligns environmental conservation with social empowerment,\" said Fernando A. González, CEO of Cemex.\u201d \u201cThe Very Nile initiative exemplifies how companies can collaborate with NGO\u2019s and society to change the world for the better.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s social impact strategy focuses on making a positive, lasting difference in cities and communities worldwide by supporting local economies, building resilient communities, and empowering people through skills development for employability and entrepreneurship. Cemex implements this strategy in collaboration with community leaders and local stakeholders.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2020, Fortune recognized Cemex for building mobile hospitals with antibacterial concrete modules in record time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The \u2018Our Growing Platform\u2019 initiative was awarded in 2017 for collaboratively addressing the challenges of housing and inequality in vulnerable communities. Two years earlier, in 2015, Cemex was honoured for its \u2018Patrimonio Hoy\u2019 program, which provides low-income families with access to building materials, microfinancing, technical advice, and logistical support to help them build their homes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Fortune Change the World list highlights companies that use their innovative capabilities to tackle social challenges, leveraging business success to pursue goals that are as crucial as, or even more important than, financial gains. This year, companies were clustered into four groups, with some falling into multiple categories: environmental impact, economic opportunity, public health, and human rights. In assessing the nominees, the most critical factors considered were measurable social impact, business results, and the degree of innovation.<\/p>\n\n<p>This year's list includes 30 from North America, 12 from Europe, 8 from Asia and Australia, one from Africa, and one from South America.<\/p>\n\n<p>The full Fortune 2024 Change the World list is available at: <a href=\"https://fortune.com/ranking/change-the-world/\">https://fortune.com/ranking/change-the-world/&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Cemex was recognized for its innovative VeryNile initiative in Egypt and placed in the 24th position out of 52 ranked companies.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

At Ellesmere, a 35-year old dryer machine will be replaced with a new, more efficient machine at the end October, whilst at Sheffield, Huyton and Preston, important weighbridge replacement programmes have future-proofed the sites for another 25-30 years. The bag house at Preston has also been replaced in June this year, with a better design, to aid extraction and improve overall operational efficiency by filtering the extraction air from the burner.

This project is one of those tools. The Rüdersdorf project is Cemex\u2019s largest CCUS project to date, with all the hallmarks and credentials to make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of the cement industry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>At Rüdersdorf, Linde\u2019s pioneering HISORP®, CO2 capture technology will be deployed for the first time in a unique state-of-the-art cryogenic-adsorptive process that captures CO2 from the exhaust gas directly at the emission source. The raw CO2 is then compressed and liquefied so that it meets the purity requirements for subsequent sequestration. Finally, the liquid CO2 product will be transported by rail to an intermediate CO2 Hub and shipped to an offshore storage site in the North Sea for permanent storage. The environmental credentials of this full chain CCUS project at Rüdersdorf will be further enhanced and supported by the regional generation of green electricity and the recycling of water obtained from the condensation of exhaust gases. CCUS is part of the roadmap for Future in Action, Cemex's sustainability and decarbonization program, with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050. Through Future in Action, Cemex has achieved record-breaking progress in reducing its carbon footprint since its launch in 2020.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Delivery by train produces around 50% less CO2 per ton-mile than a road vehicle, largely in part to their ability to carry significantly increased volumes of materials. We\u2019re extremely proud of the growth that we have seen across our rail operations at Cemex in recent years, and of the contribution that this has made to our overall sustainability commitments. It remains a key focus area which we intend to continue to grow, and it will play an ever-increasing role in our supply chain network.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Alongside supporting Cemex with their rail operations at Dove Holes, Victa Railfreight provides a wide range of services to customers and suppliers in the freight industry throughout the UK. Since forming in 1995 the company has constantly adapted to the evolving landscape of the rail freight industry and their product portfolio now provides a range of operational, safety and logistics services to rail freight operators and customers across the UK.<\/p>\n\n<p>Victa Railfreight\u2019s Managing Director, Neil Sime, said \u201cwe are delighted to have renewed our partnership with Cemex at Dove Holes. Over the past five years we have worked hard to provide a safe, high quality and responsive service and to work with Cemex and the other FOC\u2019s to maximise the volumes out of Dove Holes and deliver a very high level of performance, consistently delivering 99% plus of all outbound trains \u2018on time and in full\u2019 to the trunk rail operators\u2019 at the departure point for onwards haulage.<\/p>\n\n<p>This level of service is testament to our dedicated team of Rail Logistics Operators, all of whom have been recruited new to the rail industry and have been trained in house to handle the shunting and main line loco driving duties required to fulfil our operation at Dove Holes. In addition, our contract management adds enormous value by dealing with the interfaces and liaison with all parties to optimise resource utilisation and quickly respond to service disruption and volume fluctuations.<\/p>\n\n<p>This commitment, coupled with a high level of cooperation between the parties has been a key driver in the growth of rail volumes from the quarry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex is an industry leading global construction materials and solutions company that is building a better future through more sustainable products and solutions.

Steve worked alongside the Works Engineer, Jack Barker, for around six months, when Jack then took early retirement due to ill health, at which time Steve then took over as Works Engineer.

In 1998 he became the Engineering Manager under Mike, who left a few years later and was succeeded by Martin Downey. In 2005 Cemex completed its acquisition of RMC and in 2008 Steve became Quarry Manager/Engineering Manager.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kevin Cage, Head of UK Aggregate Operations, has worked with Steve since 1990 and sent the following message for Steve: \u201cI would personally like to thank Steve for his hard work, dedication and commitment to our company over the years.

Thank you Steve, and many congratulations on achieving this special milestone!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve will be celebrating his significant milestone with the Operations team from Dove Holes quarry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Joining Steve in his celebrations at the end of this month will be his daughter, Samantha Culshaw, and his son, Adrian, who are both celebrating their 12<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;year working for Cemex! Sam started as an Area Sales Manager in Concrete Products and has progressed to National Sales Manager, and Adrian began working on the Weighbridge at Dove Holes on nights and is now an Electrician in the quarry. Congratulations to the whole family \u2013 we hope you will enjoy celebrating your fantastic milestones together!<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The partnership began in 2009 and was created to improve outcomes for both species and habitats, in particular through restoring quarries once they have reached the end of their working life.<\/p>\n\n<p>These restoration projects now cover over 600 hectares of grasslands; over 177 hectares of woodland; 100 hectares of heathland, and 190 hectares of ponds and open water with more than 100,000 trees planted in the process. In providing much needed habitat for a diverse range wildlife, the former quarry land is now providing homes for 46 threatened species of bird, including Willow Tit, Twite, Chough and Turtle Doves.<\/p>\n\n<p>The anniversary was celebrated with a special event at The Lodge, the RSPB\u2019s headquarters in Sandy, Bedfordshire, where teams from both organisations reflected on the success of the partnership to date and discussed priorities for the future. With plans to continue the collaboration, it is hoped that learnings from the project can help influence policy and practices to better benefit nature and the response to climate change across the sector.<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Spencer, Vice President for Sustainability and Corporate Affairs at Cemex, said \u201cThis partnership is great example of what can be achieved through long term collaboration that fosters a deep level of trust and transparency. It continues to make good business and economic sense, and has delivered positive outcomes for nature and society, with over 1,750 hectares of priority habitat having been restored to date. I\u2019m excited to see what we can achieve together over the next 15 years.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Moving forwards, Cemex will continue to prioritise its partnership with the RSPB to enhance biodiversity, and this forms one of the six pillars of its global Future in Action programme, which sets out the roadmap for Cemex to become a carbon net zero business by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>By incorporating biodiversity considerations from the earliest stages of quarry planning, the partnership is helping to minimise environmental impact and create a positive lasting legacy. The development of a habitat-mapping roadmap is enabling Cemex to measure the current levels of biodiversity at its sites, to ensure that its restoration work can be recorded and measured through the establishment of a series of metrics.<\/p>\n\n<p>This will support Cemex\u2019s future biodiversity programme, Nature Positive by 2030, which focuses on baselining biodiversity levels at existing sites and implementing strategies to increase biodiversity on all sites over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>The success of the partnership in the UK has been an important model to also inform conservation efforts elsewhere, including through Birdlife International partners across Europe. Developing partnerships within other European Operations, Cemex continues to cement its commitment to enhance biodiversity as responsible stewards of the land it manages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, commented that, \u201cTogether with Cemex, we've restored habitats, supported threatened bird species, and demonstrated the power of business conservation collaboration within the UK and beyond. As we navigate future challenges and continue in partnership to advocate for industry-wide support of these practices, we're excited to continue our work, towards a shared vision of a thriving natural world for us all to enjoy\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sean Cassidy, Biodiversity Manager across Cemex\u2019s European teams, comments that, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a real improvement in the quality of our restoration work over the period of the partnership, and this is a direct result of working closely with the RSPB, who bring specialist knowledge, skills and expertise in this area. It\u2019s also a result of the dedication of our site managers and their teams and our ability to better support them with measuring the effectiveness of this vital work.\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>SUEZ works with Cemex, a leading provider of cement and building materials, to produce an alternative fuel to heat the kiln at its cement plant in Rugby, Warwickshire. As well as using Climafuel® to heat the process at Rugby, the ash that is produced from this is then also incorporated into the clinker produced in the kiln, which is the primary ingredient for the cement making process.<\/p>\n\n<p>During a visit to mark the milestone, Environment Minister Mary Creagh was shown how the facility uses household, commercial and industrial waste to produce the alternative fuel, called Climafuel®.<\/p>\n\n<p>SUEZ processes non-recyclable waste at its purpose-built facility in Rugby to produce the sustainable replacement for coal and oil. The facility creates the high-energy fuel from carefully sifted and shredded waste primarily from local authority waste collections, as well as from businesses across the Midlands, which is then used to heat the kiln at the neighbouring Cemex facility for cement production.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since the facility opened in 2015, 1 million tonnes of Climafuel® has been provided to Cemex, allowing the building materials provider to supply their customers with more sustainable products including cement, readymix concrete and specialised urbanisation solutions such as mortars, admixtures and pre-cast concrete solutions. These materials are then used for a variety of vital building, construction and infrastructure projects across the UK including new homes, schools and hospitals as well as national road and rail improvements.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dr Adam Read MBE, Chief External Affairs and Sustainability Officer said, \u201cThe waste and resources industry is at the very heart of tackling the climate crisis. Our sector underpins green transitions across a number of industries, including providing a resource for alternative fuels to allow industries such as the construction industry to become more circular.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have been working in partnership with Cemex since 2013 and it\u2019s fantastic to see such a milestone achieved as the UK looks to decarbonise as one of the ways to cut its global emissions. It is a real win-win for both our customer and the environment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The use of Climafuel® not only supports the transition away from fossil fuels and provides a reliable source of energy, but also provides customers with a long-term sustainable solution for their waste materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Circular Economy Minister Mary Creagh said, \u201cWe know far too many of our precious resources are going to waste and that we need bold, innovative approaches to maximise their value.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis government is committed to cutting waste and moving to a circular economy so that we keep resources in use for longer, accelerate the path to net zero, and increase investment in critical infrastructure and green jobs.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhere waste cannot be avoided, it is essential to explore what other benefits it can provide \u2013 such as in energy generation. That\u2019s why I was delighted to visit SUEZ\u2019s Malpass Farm facility today as they celebrated their significant milestone, providing a shining example of partnership working in action.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Phil Baynes-Clarke, Director of Cement Operations for Cemex UK, said: \u201cOur global Future in Action programme underscores our commitment to achieving carbon net zero by 2050. Our partnership with SUEZ has been instrumental in significantly reducing carbon emissions at our Rugby Cement Plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cSince 2013, we have collaborated closely with SUEZ to produce Climafuel®, a waste-derived, non-fossil-based alternative fuel used to heat the kiln in the cement-making process. This partnership is a great example of how the cement and waste management industries can work together to deliver circularity solutions that cut carbon emissions and divert waste from landfills.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOver the past decade, Climafuel® usage has steadily increased at our Rugby Cement Plant. Our ultimate goal is to operate the kiln with 100% alternative fuels, and we are getting close to this target. Through ongoing innovation, we are determined to continue decarbonising our operations and advancing towards our goal of carbon neutrality.\u201d<\/p>"

The quality of the on-the-job training, the high standards of Health and Safety and the fact that I was immediately involved in current projects has given me a fantastic experience so far. For me, I love the fact that the work I am doing has a direct impact on our Future in Action Strategy, and that is really important to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Due to the quality of the placement work and world-class experience at Cemex Rugby, David achieved a high distinction in his placement module for his one-year placement at Cemex. His experience at Cemex has been positively shaped by the company\u2019s friendly environment, open-door policy, and the unwavering support of his colleagues.<\/p>\n\n<p>David\u2019s current role a Process and Continuous Improvement Engineer involves process optimisation, root cause analysis, and he delighted to be directly involved in Rugby\u2019s decarbonisation projects. His experience at Cemex not only provides him with immediate involvement in significant initiatives but also exposes him to invaluable experiences that continue to enrich David\u2019s professional journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>David\u2019s Line Manager and mentor, Process and Continuous Improvement Manager, Baiba Medne, said: \u201cI came across David\u2019s CV during his application for the Process Engineer role at the Rugby Cement Plant and was taken by his prior experience at the Dangote Cement Plant in Nigeria. During the interview, David stood out from other candidates with his confidence, strong presentation skills, and well-prepared questions. His thorough understanding of Cemex\u2019s profile, vision, and goals highlighted his motivation and genuine interest in our company. Over the course of a one-year work placement, David proved to be a reliable, driven, and passionate young engineer eager to learn and grow. I was particularly impressed by his confidence and proactive approach, especially his initiative in leading technical and safety-related meetings. Supporting and observing David\u2019s professional development during this year was a rewarding experience for me as a new Manager. David has become a vital member of the Rugby Process team. His collaborative spirit and attentiveness to team dynamics ensure that colleagues feel supported and that tasks remain on track. We already miss his presence and contributions while he is back at university.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>David\u2019s journey is a testament to his commitment to professional growth and his passion for sustainable engineering. He exemplifies the qualities of a driven and capable engineer ready to make a significant impact in the industry.<\/p>"

The primary objective of this drill was to create and test a rescue plan for a casualty rescue scenario, ensuring that both Cemex and DFRS are well-prepared for any real-life emergencies.",

        "Body": "<p>The drill was meticulously planned and executed as a real-time incident to provide a realistic training environment. This approach aimed to foster collaboration with the Fire and Rescue service, including their control room, and to establish strong working relationships. Additionally, it offered Cemex site staff with valuable experience in testing response times and validating the effectiveness of their emergency procedures.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rick Hughes, the Nightshift Supervisor at Dove Holes, led the drill, which involved two casualty rescues from the rail load-out. The scenario included one unconscious dummy casualty in the rail shuttle and one live casualty with broken legs on the walkway. The Rail operative discovered the casualties and radioed for first aiders, who then called 999. Derbyshire Fire and Rescue performed a rope rescue, administered CPR to the unconscious casualty, and relocated both casualties to a safe space<\/p>\n\n<p>The drill also tested various emergency procedures, including radio messages, first aid, and working at height. The exercise highlighted several positive aspects, such as excellent communication with incoming emergency services using pick-ups and weighbridge staff, a swift response from on-site first aiders, and effective handover to emergency services. However, it also identified areas for improvement, including radio etiquette during emergencies, managing production and heavy traffic during emergency service arrivals, and enhancing first aid training.<\/p>\n\n<p>The joint exercise was a perfect opportunity for Rick, who also serves as a retained firefighter for Derbyshire Fire and Rescue, to bridge his roles and facilitate collaboration. The drill not only benefited Cemex but also provided valuable training for DFRS, particularly given the presence of several quarries in the area, which pose unique risks to the service.<\/p>\n\n<p>The drill concluded with a debriefing session where both organisations reviewed the exercise from start to finish, discussed what went well, and identified areas for improvement. The debriefing followed the IIMARCH framework, covering Information, Intent, Method, Administration, Risk assessment, Communication, and Humanitarian Issues<\/p>\n\n<p>Congratulations to everyone involved. Overall, the joint emergency drill was a resounding success, demonstrating the importance of preparedness, coordination, and continuous learning in ensuring the safety and well-being of all involved.<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Launched in 2022, the partnership originally aimed to support local fishing communities through the collecting and processing of solid waste from the river, but has since created various educational, environmental, social and job opportunities for people across the country.<\/p>\n\n<p>As of late 2024, Cemex has helped to collect over 575 tons of waste from the Nile, including through its employees\u2019 participation in several volunteering activities to clean up the river. Of the total amount of waste collected, Cemex has repurposed more than 460 tons as alternative fuels at its Assiut Cement Plant, supporting its circularity strategy.<\/p>\n\n<p>The partnership has also enabled VeryNile to expand its operations, including launching its Assiut Hub in Cemex Egypt\u2019s operational hometown. Through this, more than 360 new job opportunities were created, including for local fishing communities, increasing the capacity for waste collection from the Nile.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the partnership is helping to foster community and sustainable development through the creation of social and educational initiatives. In 2023, Cemex\u2019s Assiut Cement Football Club launched a new branch of its academy on Qursaya Island in Cairo, providing young people with an opportunity to play sports and nurture their skills in a professional and safe environment with advanced facilities, rigorous training programmes and experienced coaches.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result of this collaborative effort, Cemex was included in Fortune's 2024 Change the World list, ranking 24th out of 52 companies. This marks the fourth time Cemex has received this recognition, which celebrates businesses creating positive social impact through local partnerships.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yago Castro Izaguirre, President of Cemex Egypt and UAE, said: \u201cSupporting initiatives that can leave a lasting positive impact on the environment and our communities is at the forefront of Cemex\u2019s mission to build a better future for all. With VeryNile, we are alleviating pollution issues within the Nile River through waste management solutions and developing programmes that can enable people of all ages to grow, prosper and succeed. Together, we continue to enhance and empower communities across Egypt.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About VeryNile<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>VeryNile is an initiative that develops more sustainable means to clean the Nile while raising awareness on the importance of protecting the environment. VeryNile interlaces social and environmental impact and develops eco-friendly solutions to remove inorganic waste from the Nile River.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px\">&nbsp;<\/p>"
