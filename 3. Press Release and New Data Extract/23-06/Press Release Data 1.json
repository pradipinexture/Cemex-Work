Other finds include finely worked, leaf-shaped flint arrowheads, serrated blades, stone axes and grinding stones.<\/p>\n<p>About 80 Neolithic monuments have been identified in Britain, but Archaeologists are particularly excited by this one as they expect to uncover the entire circuit of the enclosure.

They regularly attend the Logistic Leadership Days at Thorpe and have always had a valued input into the day. <br><br>They have become CLOCs Champions from 2016, as well as maintaining our FORS gold accreditation status which was first achieved back in 2015.

Expert speakers contributed on current issues related to nature conservation. The event showcased some of the best examples of Quarry restoration and wildlife conservation anywhere in Europe that were entered for the MPA Restoration Awards and the MPA Biodiversity Awards in association with Natural England.  A series of outstanding images were also presented as part of the MPA\u2019s Nature Photo competition. The MPA also launched Quarrywatch which will involve focused nature surveys at designated locations to gain a picture of the species colonising restored quarries and other nature sites. Local wildlife groups, individual enthusiasts and schools will also be invited to take part in the initiative.　<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Commenting, Nigel Jackson, Chief Executive of the MPA, said: \u201cOnce again MPA members\u2019 have demonstrated what an environmentally responsible industry can do to both protect existing and create new habitats. We could not be more proud to showcase what can be achieved by an industry that is uniquely placed to make a net gain to biodiversity.\u201d　<\/p>\n\n<p>MPA members are planning to increase the area of priority habitats on restored sites from 6,000 hectares currently to around 9,000 hectares in coming years, and increase the length of hedgerows planted from 79 km to 237 km.  The area of priority habitat would be equivalent to the size of Cardiff, and hedgerow would stretch from London to Cardiff.<\/p>"

A pre-event safety visit to the site was arranged with the Triathlon organiser to ensure a safe and suitable location for the truck to exhibit. The event took place on Sunday 17th September and went very well, with a large number of visitors and competitors climbing into the cab to see the road from the truck driver\u2019s seat. Demonstrations of the additional safety features fitted to the CEMEX fleet vehicles were well received, along with the high level of training given to develop driver skills. This helps them understand where the danger areas and blind spots associated with large vehicles are and how to avoid them. Thanks go to Phil Hutchinson and Ian Phoenix for organising the event and to North East lead driver, Mark Mann, and Jarrow driver, Lawrence Stobbs, who both gave up Sunday to support the event.

It has over 20 years\u2019 experience in manufacturing pre-stressed concrete sleepers and crossing bearers which are used in high speed, main-line railway track applications and railway lines.

The site has been used by CEMEX for 26 years and employs 90 onsite staff.　<\/p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Manufacturing large concrete sleepers and crossing bearers requires heavy machinery, with the product often moving around this busy site.  Adhering to strict health and safety procedures at all times is understandably essential for the safety of everyone on site. Terry Gillooly, Washwood Heath Site Manager for CEMEX Rail Solutions, sees health and safety as the No.1 priority and an ongoing process of continuous improvement: \u201cWe are always looking for ways we can improve the site and keep staff working safely.  I put forward the idea of a CCTV system as a means of maintaining site safety.  We could also use it for security as we have our own rail sidings, but this was not the main reason.  We discussed it and thought it was a good idea. \u201cStanley supplies our Time and Attendance equipment\u201d explains Terry \u201cand I mentioned the issues we were having with the CCTV company by chance and they offered their services, which was great.  They did a very good job.  The system is very professional.\u201d STANLEY recommended a 16 camera IP HD CCTV system, capable of providing high definition observation.  A range of external and internal cameras have been installed in strategic positions across the site with all images fed back for monitoring and recording onto a sophisticated network video recorder.  The system runs over CEMEX\u2019s existing IP network, providing considerable cost savings on cabling required for traditional CCTV systems, whilst maintaining quality.  Due to the nature of the site, the entire CCTV system was installed out of hours over three weekends with STANLEY staff working to very strict health and safety criteria.　<\/p>\n<p>CEMEX  is impressed with the finished CCTV system and the way in which the installation was carried out.  \u201cOver several visits to our site, Stanley\u2019s team adhered to all Health and Safety procedures, including the use and operation of the site\u2019s mobile elevated platform\u201d states Terry.  \u201cThe conduct of the team was excellent, and works were completed in a timely manner.  We are very pleased with the CCTV system.\u201d The installation has proven so successful that CEMEX has expanded the system by adding a further eight cameras.<\/p>"

It is known locally for high quality aggregates and ready mix concrete which is delivered across the region. The site was awarded PRIME (Professional Recognition in Mineral Extraction) status at the start of August 2017. <\/p><p>Sam Shepherd has been the Assistant quarry manager and then Quarry manager at CEMEX\u2019s Pallett Hill quarry  over last three years. He says: <em>\u201cMy first involvement with PRIME was back in 2015 and I immediately knew that this was a standard this site could and would achieve. It has  the associated professional benefits of being recognised for what we do, as well as the joint kudos for everyone involved at Pallett Hill, as achieving PRIME is a true team effort.\u201d<\/em> <\/p><p>PRIME is the driving force behind the introduction of the new Technical Member (TMIQ) grade. TMIQ is awarded to employees who achieve vocational and other qualifications, along with the completion of Continuing Professional Development (CPD). Mike Phillips, General Manager, IQ personally conducted the site audit at Pallett Hill. <\/p><p>The quarry is a site close to his heart, having being involved with the site earlier in his career. Mike commented: <em>\u201cIt was great to spend time at Pallett Hill and it brought back many happy memories. Having visited and toured this site I can see a real change. The continued improvements are really noticeable and I hope the further work into the future carries on. The introduction of a quarry vegetable patch was one of many innovative ideas where managers, supervisors and operatives can truly work together and glean true value from their time at work. Personally I was very impressed with Sam\u2019s attitude and approach towards modern day quarry management and this clearly shows it works.\u201d<\/em> <\/p><p>Sam Shepherd, Quarry Manager, CEMEX, adds: <em>\u201cHaving being involved in the steering group for PRIME, I understand the rigour with which the audit process is undertaken, so I am very proud of the team here for being recognised as the true professionals that they are. I know that we are one of the first within CEMEX to achieve this accolade, and hope that many sites will follow in our footsteps. This process has led to improvement not only for myself and my team, but for the site as a whole. We all understand the value of increased morale and engagement, and the celebration of this achievement, along with the friendly competition it will engender is a positive influence for all.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

Swifts will soon be on their way back to Africa so our \u2018new build\u2019 is in preparation for next year. Next summer we look forward to seeing and hearing Swifts as they soar over Rugby rooftops on a summer\u2019s evening,\u201d<\/em> comments Jamie Jordan, Environmental Manager, Rugby Cement Plant.<\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"> Swifts are the perfect house guest. They are only in the UK for three months of the year; make no mess when nesting and help get rid of flying insects and mosquitoes. <\/p><p dir=\"LTR\">Sadly, their numbers have been rapidly declining, due in part it is thought, to the lack of homes in our urban environments. CEMEX is working in partnership with the RSPB to increase the biodiversity of its 400+ sites.<\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"> The introduction of the Swift boxes is one of the measures to help give nature a home. Rebecca Pitman, RSPB Swift Cities Project Officer, says: <em>\u201cThe Swift is truly an urban bird and sadly they have declined by an alarming 47% between 1995\u20132014. <\/em><\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"><em>\"They are now an amber-listed species on the list of Birds of Conservation Concern. When they arrive back in the UK from Africa they return to the exact same location year after year. <\/em><\/p><p dir=\"LTR\"><em>\"Swifts like to nest in the rooftops of old buildings but developments and renovations often destroy suitable sites. The new CEMEX homes at the Cement Plant can offer this great bird a great home,\u201d<\/em> Rebecca concludes.<\/p>"

We formed two teams with one each on the mattock/bar and shovel and barrow \u2013 we soon got it done with good team work and can-do. Thanks also for everyone remembering to bring appropriate PPE for the task and looking out for each other. <\/p><p>CEMEX has a long history supporting 1st Long Itchington Scouts going back to the cement days at Southam, and still rents the scout hut, grounds, cricket pitch and pavilion to the scouts. This is the second lend-a-hand with them. Last year\u2019s project of cutting a safe walkway from the hut to the cricket pitch is still looking good and is in regular use. This is definitely a good example of CEMEX Best for Communities in action. The photo shows work in progress before we got too ragged!\u201d<\/p>"
