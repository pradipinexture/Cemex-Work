        "Display Title": "Cemex provides sparkling white concrete  for the Îlot Saint-Germain real estate project",
        "Body": "<p>Located on rue Saint-Dominique in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, the development involved rehabilitating and restructuring three buildings of the Îlot Saint-Germain into housing and facilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>The facilities part of the scheme included the creation of a gymnasium-garden within a complex of 254 rehabilitated housing units, a nursery with 68 cradles, and a 600 m² garden. The gymnasium is equipped with a 60-seat grandstand and a 300 m² multi-sport hall. The gymnasium's sleek architecture highlights the garden placed on a glazed band of the building. Only concrete screens stripe an entirely white volume, allowing natural light to illuminate a play area, winter gardens, and a dance hall. A planted patio connects the different elements of the project.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the architect required ultra-white concrete, Cemex's Parisian production units at Port Victor and Tolbiac expertly met the expectations imposed by this site, both in terms of the rigor of concrete production and the technicality of the formulas. Cemex supplied 2,500 m³ of concrete for this project, including 1,500 m³ of architectural and self-placing concrete based on white cement mixed with white and beige pigment. These concretes were respectively intended for the realisation of the screens and walls of the nursery, and the construction of the walls of the sports facilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex also advised and provided pumping services to facilitate the implementation of the concrete. The company GTM carried out meticulous work in implementing this concrete in particularly complex, narrow, and hard-to-reach formwork.<\/p>\n\n<p>All these constraints required a very fluid, stable, and consistently high-quality concrete formula, a challenge successfully met by Cemex's quality and production services. Well before the start of the site, significant specification work had taken place, and several samples were submitted to the architect until the ideal formula was validated.<\/p>\n\n<p>This development was recognised during the 4th edition of the Trophée Béton Pro (Trophies concrete Pro), which rewards architectural projects using concrete in an innovative, sustainable, and aesthetic way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Michel Andre, VP of Materials for Western Europe said: \u201c\"The successful completion of this project highlights the exceptional collaboration and dedication of our teams across various departments, including prescription, commercial, quality, production, delivery, and handling. Our ability to meet the stringent requirements of the Îlot Saint-Germain development with our ultra-white concrete is a testament to Cemex's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about Cemex, visit <a href=\"http://www.cemex.co.uk\">www.cemex.co.uk<\/a><\/p>"

It aims to optimise the sector\u2019s role in delivering across critical areas including the national freight network, net zero, planning, developing people and skills as well as data and technology.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex has been a long-standing advocate of the UK government\u2019s modal shift ambitions and, as well as using rail, Cemex also utilises inland waterway and the UK coastline to transport materials around the country using a mixture of barges, tugboats, ships and dredging vessels, all of which directly contributes towards the Government\u2019s active travel targets by reducing congestion on the UK\u2019s road network.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a global organisation, Cemex is also able to leverage its international expertise to optimise supply chains and offer practical, actionable advice and guidance directly to leading policymakers on topics such as safety, decarbonisation, alternative fuel usage, supply chain resilience and options to support economic growth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex produces a variety of building and construction materials including readymix concrete, cement, mortar, asphalt, flooring and paving solutions for use in vital building, construction and infrastructure projects across the UK and beyond. The global building materials provider has a proud heritage in the UK, tracing its origins back to a small family business formed in 1826 who initially started producing lime mortar at a site in Rugby, Warwickshire, where the organisation is still based today.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex currently operates more than 20 quarries, 2 cement plants, 90 concrete mixing plants and a supply chain network boasting a significant logistical capability with a fleet of modern vehicles, locomotives and vessels that supports the delivery of essential building and construction materials throughout the UK by road, rail, river and sea.<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Biodiversity Net Gain is an approach that aims to ensure future UK developments create a positive lasting impact on our natural environment by implementing a minimum target for new developments to achieve a 10% uplift in the biodiversity of a site.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Cemex has created a dedicated BNG service in response to the new legislation, which utilises its access to an established portfolio of sites alongside its considerable expertise gained from a long-standing history in nature recovery, land restoration, and enhancing biodiversity across its sites for the benefit of the natural environment.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Steve Redwood, Land Development and Property Director for Cemex, says, \u201cOur Biodiversity Net Gain offering can help organisations who are new to biodiversity enhancement projects, those who may not have the inhouse skills or knowledge, and companies working with sites where biodiversity net gain targets will be difficult or costly to achieve.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">\u201cCemex\u2019s Biodiversity Net Gain service will help guide businesses through the entire lifecycle approach from initial assessment to unit purchase and long-term habitat management with no further input required, ensuring a hassle-free approach to the management and realisation of biodiversity net gain. For developers, Cemex\u2019s offer will help to deliver biodiversity net gain without the pain; that may otherwise be associated with challenging or difficult to deliver sites.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In order to achieve the 10% increase in biodiversity, organisations will need to conduct a \u2018Biodiversity Baseline Assessment\u2019 of a site before any work starts. This will measure the existing biodiversity of a site using the Defra<b> <\/b>Biodiversity Metric (currently Biodiversity Metric 4.0). Developers will then be required to demonstrate a 10% increase in biodiversity units compared to this baseline.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">As well as demonstrating <span style=\"color:black\">how the development will achieve a 10% increase in biodiversity units, companies will also need to show how<\/span> the biodiversity units will be maintained for at least 30 years. The information submitted to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) must therefore, also contain a management and monitoring plan to ensure that habitats are established properly <span style=\"color:black\">and that they<\/span> deliver the long-term benefits to our environment that the introduction of BNG is intended to deliver.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">It is now a condition of planning permission that a development cannot commence without an LPA approved Biodiversity Gain Plan in place. However, Biodiversity Gain Plans are complex by their very nature and involve <span style=\"color:black\">specialist<\/span> ecology support with the Biodiversity Metric calculations and legal advice on long-term habitat creation agreements.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Whilst the aim of BNG is for businesses to deliver these enhancements locally as part of the development of a site, there is also a recognition that for some developments, particularly in urban or high-density areas, it may be extremely challenging, too time-consuming or <span style=\"color:black\">quite simply<\/span> not cost-effective, to achieve the mandatory 10% uplift in biodiversity units required.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In these examples, if a developer cannot achieve a 10% biodiversity gain on-site, they can purchase units from third party landowners who may have exceeded their own biodiversity requirements and therefore have a surplus of biodiversity credits that can be traded.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">To find out more please go to: <span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Aptos&quot;,sans-serif\"><a href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cemex.co.uk%2Fbiodiversity-net-gain-without-the-pain&amp;data=05%7C02%7Ctina.baxter%40cemex.com%7Cd54dd7aac41f459f40fe08dda41e32e4%7C6ee19001d0c445f8af8bff00f16d07e1%7C0%7C0%7C638847171849151751%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=RKwI%2BF6hXTCGeHtC2zMUMvMVCl0u%2BLA5PJ0fvqb6h40%3D&amp;reserved=0\" style=\"color:#467886; text-decoration:underline\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/biodiversity-net-gain-without-the-pain<\/a><\/span><\/span> or contact enquiries@venniwildservice.co.uk<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Cemex is consistently expanding its portfolio of photovoltaic farms in Central Europe Materials, which reduces our company\u2019s reliance on traditional energy methods and provides a long-term return on investment by saving on energy costs. One of the main benefits is also conducting business in accordance with environmental conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, Cemex plants in this area operate five photovoltaic farms - four of them are in Germany and one in Pruszków near Warsaw. Soon, there will be a total of nine such farms in Poland. New installations will be also launched on the premises of cement plants and concrete plants in Mysłowice, Warsaw, Lublin, Szczecin, Gdańsk, and at the mine in Mirowo quarry under an agreement with EDP Energia Polska, which is part of the European leader in solar solutions, photovoltaic installations will be built, the total capacity of which will exceed 14 MWp.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore in Berlin (Germany) Cemex will install additional 30 kWp at a Ready-Mix-Plant powering not only the batching plant but also the electric mixer fleet with solar energy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Existing farms already supply Cemex plants in Central Europe Materials with 128,4MWh of energy per month. Once the new installations are up and running, this will amount to as much as 291,4 MWh.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the era of ongoing climate change, we need investments that will allow our societies to develop in a more sustainable manner while also increasing our company\u2019s efficiency. Obtaining energy from renewable sources, which reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and cuts our use of traditional energy methods, is key in this context. Cemex consistently increases the share of renewable energy in its energy mix. Thanks to this, we can expand our offer of lower-emission products, supporting customers in reducing the carbon footprint of their investments - says Patryk Czaplewski, Director of Operational Excellence for Central Europe at Cemex.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first Cemex photovoltaic farms in Central Europe were launched in 2022in Germany. It is in this country that Cemex has its largest solar installation in the region. The floating photovoltaic farm on the reservoir in the Immelborn gravel pit (near Erfurt) has a capacity of 750 kWp and produces approximately 830 MWh of energy per year.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first photovoltaic farm on the premises of the Polish Cemex plants was built four years ago at the ready-mix concrete plant in Pruszków. 124 panels have a total capacity of 50 kWp, and the annual energy production from this installation meets 20% of the plant's demand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Investments in photovoltaics are not the only activities of Cemex in the area of renewable energy. In this context, the contract with the Norwegian company Statkraft is also worth noting, which at the beginning of 2025 began to supply Polish Cemex plants with energy from domestic wind and photovoltaic farms. The contract with Statkraft will be valid for 8 years, securing 30% of Cemex Polska's energy needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>## Ends ##<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:<br />\nCemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% alternative fuel use<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30%<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is an industry leading global construction materials and solutions company that is building a better future safely through more sustainable products and solutions.
