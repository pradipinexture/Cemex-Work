        "Body": "<p>Last month Matthew Doran, Sales Readymix Rep, was approached by John Robertson, Centre Manager at Bradby Boys Club in Rugby town. <\/p><p>John was looking for some help with a project of his that required Readymix concrete so obviously he contacted the one company whose name is synonymous throughout the town of Rugby. <\/p><p>The gym at the Club had fallen victim to flooding every time there was heavy rain due to a long cavity around the front of the building which needed filling. <\/p><p>Matt takes up the story: <em>\u201cLast Friday CEMEX delivered 1m3 of concrete to fill in the void which will now allow rainwater to drain down into the car park area as opposed to under the door and all over the gym floor. Not only that, Rugby IHC, Dean Chater, was seen mucking in and helping the centre staff with some free manual labour! (I was too busy supervising......).\"<\/em> <\/p><p>After the delivery John had the following to say:<em> \u201cHaving a community gym at the Bradby Club is a massive benefit to the community and all the young people that use the Centre, and it has always been one of our most popular activities, however, we have always had a problem with it flooding which has hindered any improvements that we have tried to make. Thanks to the generosity of Matt and CEMEX our gym is now water tight for the first time since I can remember\"<\/em><\/p>"

This is what they did: Having previously organised Driver Health & Safety Meetings in groups of 10+ Hazelcroft Garage recognised that the format was not working, and due to the large numbers attending, drivers were reluctant to open up and discuss any issues. <\/p>  <p>In 2016 Hazelcroft Garage introduced their Driver Health & Safety forums which take place in groups of four. The meetings start with a review of the Minutes from the last meeting before reviewing Safety Alerts, Near Miss Hazard Alert Forms and completing any new Near Miss Hazard Alert Forms for any issues raised during the meeting. <\/p><p>Minutes are taken and reviewed at every meeting ensuring that all concerns and issues are recorded and drivers can be kept updated on progress. Hazelcroft Garage now feel that a positive health & safety culture is now being embraced rather than becoming a \u2018tick box\u2019 exercise. <\/p><p>The picture is of Ronnie Simpson (left) presenting the certificate to Ian Tomlinson (owner of Hazelcroft Garage, right), and the red letter prize to Driver, Nigel Clark (centre).<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The Bedale bypass to which CEMEX supplied 22,000 tonnes of asphalt, was opened ahead of schedule on 11 August by Roads Minister Andrew Jones. It eases congestion in the town centre and improve the travel for residents, businesses and visitors. <\/p><p>The bypass is designed to reduce traffic flow through Bedale, Leeming Bar and Aiskew by half. Currently, about 14,000 vehicles a day use the existing road, which causes considerable congestion. <\/p><p>In addition to cutting traffic through the urban area by half, the bypass will reduce environmental and road safety problems, improve access to the A1(M) for local communities and improve access to Leeming Bar industrial estate. <\/p><p>Andrew Jones said: <em>\u201cThe much-needed bypass will improve the community\u2019s lives by cutting traffic, improving air quality and road safety. The tourist industry will also benefit as journey times to the beautiful Yorkshire Dales will be reduced.The government is making a record investment in roads, such as the Bedale bypass, speeding up people\u2019s journeys and boosting the economy.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

The picture clearly shows where the beams have been cut to fit into the steel work. Chris then contacted the Site Engineer and stated his findings, made them aware of the failings on site and the Site Engineer would then be able to make the relevant changes to the design.  <\/p><p>Following the CEMEX intervention the site has now made the changes the CEMEX Team noted, and because of the way that CEMEX dealt with the issue they have now said that the next contract will be coming our way.
