        "Body": "<p>A little over 12 months ago CEMEX Rail Solutions were asked by London Underground  for a design of concrete bearer for curves of less than 200m radius.  <\/p><p>The particular issue with tight curves is that of wheel / rail alignment around the curve. The way to ensure that wheels remain on the track is by use of a check rail next to the running rail; this guides the wheel and keeps it on the rail. <\/p><p>London Underground had designs of 2 base plates, one for the check rail end and one for the running rail on the other end of the bearer but needed to mount it on a concrete bearer. This was not straight forward as there were 2 complications highlighted by a Finite Element Analysis carried out by Durham University.<\/p>  <p>The method of attaching the base plate to the bearer was via a cast in plastic dowell. This is a known crack inducer in pre-stressed concrete due to tensile forcesset up around the dowell. The dowells on one end need to be in close proximity to mounting positions for 3rd and 4th conductor rail mounting positions. <\/p><p>These conductor rails are bolted on again into a plastic insert (another crack inducer). To overcome these issues we have adopted industry practice from Germany and placed a tight fitting helical reinforcement around the plastic dowells to contain cracks. <\/p><p>The plastic inserts for conductor rail mounting have been replaced by metal inserts.  A second finite element analysis by Durham University concluded that these changes had significantly reduced the risk of crack propogation within the unit.  A further 2 variants of check rail bearer were designed (short ended at either end) at the same time to allow for drainage catch pits which are sometimes in the way trackside.<\/p>  <p>Thanks to the contribution of our Operations, Maintenance and Quality Departments the 3 variants went into full production of around 100 units per week at Somercotes in early April and our client is forecasting a positive future demand by end of the year.   <\/p><p>A further variant is now being looked at to incorporate standard pandrol fastclip fastenings and inclined concrete; this would be used where the client has noise and vibration issues where a soft undersleeper pad could be used.<\/p>"

Even if they are on public pathways or gardens, both in our towns and rural areas, the charity says. <\/p><p>And it is sometimes the safer option, particularly when it comes to baby seagulls.

On a coastal island, if a crow or a great black-backed gull tries to steal and eat an egg or chick, it will be repelled with all the parent gull\u2019s strength and other gulls will come to assist. It is no different in the towns and cities of the UK.<\/em><\/p><p><em>\u201cIf the gulls believe their eggs or young are in danger, they understandably become very protective and can be aggressive in defence of their young.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

Our Technical Manager Kevin D'souza worked with Darren Williams of Propex to design the mix and run trials, only once we were completely happy did we go ahead with the pours, each load had steel and polypropylene fibres added at the plant. <\/p> <p>As with other products in the Advanced portfolio, Advanced Decking utilises fibres to eliminate the need for conventional steel mesh on site. This VAP (value added product) has two great selling points, first Heath and Safety, as there is no need to spend two days prepping the floor with steel mesh, the second time saved not having to do this, and there\u2019s no need to spend hours power floating the finished surface. <\/p> <p>Sharon commented, \u201cthe success of these pours was only achievable with the hard work of all the people involved, at the batching plant staff, and the drivers who had to negotiate the difficult site access, but this they did with ease. This job just goes to show what can be achieved when we work as a team, a great job well done, thanks to all those involved. We have other supplies in the pipeline and there will be a formal product launch in the very near future.\u201d <\/p><p> <\/p>"

The concrete flows and fully compacts without the need for external vibration enabling customers to place concrete in the most difficult locations whilst still maintaining all the hardened properties associated with traditional concrete. <\/p><p>In total we supplied 600m of material.

There is a large winter gull roost which can hold as many as 28000 birds.  Passing birds of prey include the majestic osprey, whilst buzzard and sparrowhawk can be seen regularly.   Almost any migrant bird can turn up - black tern are regulars but species like little egret and the more uncommon waders are also seen.     <\/p><p>Lackford Lakes has a thriving visitor centre with regular activities ranging from bird watching courses, to art exhibitions, to family activity days.  The reserve is free to visit and open year round.  Suffolk Wildlife Trust is the county\u2019s leading environmental charity and is supported by more than 26,000 members \u2013 joining the Trust is the best way to show your support for their conservation activities.  Find out more at: <\/p> <p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/lackfordlakes\">http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/lackfordlakes<\/a><\/p> <p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lackford-Lakes-Suffolk-Wildlife-Trust/129367447183011\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lackford-Lakes-Suffolk-Wildlife-Trust/129367447183011<\/a><\/p>Lackford Lakes is well worth a visit year round, but the months of November and December are particularly special as both the gull and starling roosts build in numbers as the sun goes down."

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX won thanks to its project to use artificial pozzolan to reduce CO2 emissions at its cement plant in San Pedro de Macoris. This project has resulted in a reduction in emissions of over 180,000 tons of CO2 a year, equivalent to what is produced by approximately 35,000 passenger vehicles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the company received special mentions for its initiatives to use natural cementitious materials and alternative fuels, which together reduce CO2 emissions by over 200,000 tons every year. Also recognized was an initiative to recover, treat, and reuse residual water in its Los Pinos ready-mix concrete plant, which reduces water use by 40%.\nCEMEX wins Dominican award for Cleanest Production<\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX reaps many benefits from its intensive use of more economical, environmentally friendly alternative fuels such as chipped tires, household waste, and biomass. The company is increasingly using alternative fuels to reduce its consumption of carbon-based fossil fuels, protect its business from volatile energy prices, and recover energy from society\u2019s waste.<\/p>\n\n<p>The use of alternative fuels is a key pillar to CEMEX\u2019s carbon strategy. Thanks to this, and many other initiatives, CEMEX is on its way to achieving its ambitious goal of a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions from its 1990 baseline by 2015<\/p>"

CEMEX\u2019s cement with chippings of shell limestone aggregate from its nearby quarry produced concrete that fully met the foundations\u2019 exacting requirements.  Using CEMEX\u2019s concrete pumps, in less than 12 hours, the concrete was placed in circular layers using continuous concreting operations to achieve the uniform strength needed for each structure.<\/p>\n<p>CEMEX adjusted the concrete mix for the upper layers of the towers to have a more rigid consistency to maintain the desired, slanted geometry of each base.  The five concrete foundations are now in place to the full satisfaction of site management. Thanks to the unique solution provided by CEMEX: aggregates, ready-mix concrete, concrete pumps, and laboratory services, the structures are now ready to withstand the tremendous stresses and strains of a modern, high-performance wind power plant.<\/p>\n    <p>CEMEX develops innovative building solutions that keep the company and its customers at the forefront of the industry.

        "Body": "<p>The school had area in between outbuildings that they wanted to use as an outdoor classroom, but unfortunately it was susceptible to water holding. In addition to this the pond that was installed last year required another path as it was quite muddy and boggy.<\/p>\n\n<p>As part of the Lendahand day, the team placed a membrane and covered it with aggregate to make the space more usable for the outdoor classroom and the pond area.<\/p>\n\n<p>The team consisted of Graham Warrington, Michael Fowler, Benjamin Lee Trotman, Ceri Mark Evans, Michael Daw and Florin Ciuperca. Well done all!!!<\/p>"
