Originally Able UK&nbsp;were looking for a standard asphalt solution for the site, however, after being presented with both asphalt and roller compacted concrete (RCC) solutions they realised that RCC&nbsp;offered a far more durable and longer term solution and it was subsequently approved by BMW.<\/p>\n\n<p>Roller compacted concrete can be mixed on-site - saving time and due to the durability of RCC it proves a more cost effective and durable solution with other less obvious benefts, such as reduced lighting requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX have supplied 82,000 tonnes of aggregate material from our Dove Holes Quarry after gaining a good understanding of the exact requirements of the project and tailoring the design to meet this. The customer was very pleased with the work carried out and have started looking at how RCC can be used on other projects at the same site.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/roller-compacted-concrete.aspx\" style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#b23035; color:#ffffff; float:right;\" title=\"Roller Compacted Concrete\">Roller Compacted Concrete<\/a><\/p>"

It was very labour intensive but the effort was worth it and the results were obvious. So much so, that the Chairperson from Friends Of Wombwell Park sent an email to thank us and was so impressed with our enthusiasm in the task, our attitude and the pride we took in our work. A big thanks to the managers who made it on the day: Andy Webster, Dean Edwards, Steve Taylor, Jason Barker, John Beard, Colin Burdett, Paul Dale and Phil Repton ( Chief Entertainments Officer).

The renovation project required a mass filling of the existing basement with 20N/mm2 concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>When contractor, Paul John construction approached CEMEX for a suitable voidfill solution, we proposed to use Porofoam, our low density foamed concrete. Using Porofoam enabled the pour to be completed in less than half the time than standard concrete. Due to it\u2019s reduced plastic density Porofoam could be placed in much thicker layers reducing lateral pressures exerted on the 165 year old internal walls of the basement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Porofoam is also self-compacting and self-levelling, which made it much easier for the contractor to place in the network of basement chambers. Porofoam is available in a range of densities and strengths and is manufactured using our proprietary CEMEX admixtures. For this project CEMEX delivered around 60m3 of pre-mixed Porofoam over 2 days to fill the void which achieved the required 20N/mm2 concrete strength.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/porofoam-lightweight-foamed-concrete-for-voidfill.aspx\" style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#b23035; color:#ffffff; font-weight:bold; float:right;\">Foamed Concrete<\/a><\/p>"

At the start of the spring we did a review of what areas our support would better benefit. I noticed that the wooden sleepers that allow members of the public safe access to other levels of the Nature Reserve were clearly becoming unsafe through wood deterioration; the hand rail had also become loose and was ready to break. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"I offered to have myself and a team replace all the sleepers that were needed and repair the hand rail to ensure many more years of use. Sometimes the best plans don\u2019t always work out - we\u2019d planned to replace 21 sleepers but following the long period of warm weather the ground was so hard it slowed us down a little. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"We managed to replace 13 sleepers on the day and we concreted-in posts to stabilise the hand rail and repainted it, offering it a few more years of use. I am proud of the work we do at Pennytown Ponds and the support we give the local community is amazing. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"Gary, our friend from the local charity, Groundwork, was working along us throughout the day and was over the moon with the results. The team here at Somercotes worked very hard so my thanks to them for making this happen.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>A month after our review the Reserve was visited by the Green Flag judges and was deemed of sufficient standard to retain the Green Flag status which has been held for a number of years.<\/p>\n\n<p>The judges highlighted that the wooden steps needed replacing and when told that this work was already scheduled with the help of CEMEX they were impressed that the work was already planned and secondly a local company was involved in the important maintenance work on a local Nature Reserve.<\/p>"

This creates a more closed, even surface rather than the more textured appearance of a natural RCC.<\/p>\n\n<p>The smooth cement paste created during this process offers increase abrasion resistance making it attractive for high stress areas. The admixture used for this scheme was originally sourced externally sourced, but our admixture team developed a CEMEX alternative which is now being used too.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the Warboys contract Garry Gregory, Director Asphalt and Paving Solutions, CEMEX UK, commented: <em>\u201cThis was a great achievement for us \u2013 it was the largest area we have laid in the UK with RCC and it was an opportunity for us to use power floating for the first time. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"For the customer, it gives a pavement which combines the strength and durability of concrete with the ease of construction of an asphalt. RCC alone can provide significant cost savings, up to 30% over traditional pavements and now with power floated RCC it offers a significantly harder wearing surface that\u2019s more aesthetically pleasing.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

Max was hit by a rock kicked up by another bike on Sunday morning which badly bruised his shoulder and then had issues with his goggles which hampered his race. This placed Max into 2nd place overall in the championship.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span>Max, aged 45, races a CR250 Super Evo bike and started racing motocross at the tender age of 5 working his way through the schoolboy ranks and then into the adult scene. Max has an interest in the spanners side and spent 7 years as a GP technician working for KTM, Suzuki and Factory Kawasaki.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span>Max will be taking part in the 2019 Super Evo Championship next year and will be hoping to go 1 better and take that prized 1st position.<\/span><\/p>"

Winter can be a tough time for Britain\u2019s wildlife.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the nights draw in and temperatures drop, native animals like hedgehogs need to find a safe, cosy spot to hibernate until spring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Food sources can also be scarce for our butterflies, birds and bees. Turning your garden into a sanctuary for woodland wildlife in autumn can make all the difference to our native species\u2019 survival.<\/p>\n\n<p>That doesn\u2019t have to mean pricey garden centre buys or hours of work. Something as simple as filling up your bird feeder, leaving your compost heap to nature or adding a few late-flowering plants will attract more animals and ensure your new guests are safe, fed and watered until the cold months have passed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the RSPB\u2019s top winter tips:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Don\u2019t be so tidy! Leave an area of your garden unkempt for wildlife to live in.<\/li>\n\t<li>Build a hedgehog house. Woodpiles are great for our spiky friends to live in and hunt for insects.<\/li>\n\t<li>Buy a bird box and give birds somewhere to shelter in the winter.<\/li>\n\t<li>Keep your pond uncovered as it will remain a crucial spot for birds to drink and find bugs and insects to eat.<\/li>\n\t<li>Top up your bird bath so birds can stay clean and keep it ice free. Putting a table tennis ball in will help as the breeze will move it and keep the bath free from ice.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add a hedge! These are great for privacy and wildlife. Evergreen hedges such as holly \u2018Handsworth New Silver\u2019 and Firethorn \u2018Teton\u2019 (Pyracantha) not only provide year-round colour but their berries provide winter food for garden birds.<\/li>\n\t<li>Make fences hedgehog friendly. If hedging isn\u2019t an option for your garden, you can create a five inch hole in the bottom of your fence or gate so that hedgehogs and other wildlife can crawl in and out.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add late flowering plants. Nectar and pollen tend to be in short supply during this time, but they are still essential foods for many insects \u2013 such as Michaelmas daisies, sedums, ivy and asters. Also, include some native trees and shrubs in your garden such as rowan, holly, guelder rose, wild rose, blackthorn or hawthorn.<\/li>\n\t<li>Add a butterfly box so insects can sleep soundly over the colder months.<\/li>\n\t<li>Fill your birdfeeder with high energy foods. Fat balls and cakes are great it\u2019s best to get the hanging feeders or enclosed ones so that the grey squirrels don\u2019t get it all!<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

        "Body": "<p>Building houses in the UK is usually centred around traditional bricks and mortar which have been the backbone of the building trade for many years. When CEMEX were approached by an ambitious self-builder, Adrian Corrigall back in 2017, the challenge was set to help create a modern family home utilising one of the most commonly used materials on the planet\u2026concrete. Usually the sole preserve of large commercial buildings, cast-in-situ concrete has rarely been the material of choice for self-builders, but Adrian\u2019s vision was very different to that of your average self-builder. Inspired by a visit to a landmark property in Mexico designed by architects Reyes Rios + Larrain Studio and supplied by CEMEX, the idea for Concrete House was shaped by the henequen hacienda style and the intelligent fabric-first design principles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concrete House was designed by Graeme Laughlin of the award-winning practice RAW Architecture Workshop. His design gives Adrian, his wife Megan and their three children a functional yet stylish house, laid out in clearly defined \u2018wings\u2019 which spur off from the central kitchen and living areas. Each area of the house sits at a slightly different level, giving a greater sense of individuality and separation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The over-riding design principles for the house were energy efficiency and use of disruptive methodologies. Adrian\u2019s vision to create a high performing house for his family was equally matched by his willingness to challenge the accepted norms of house building in the UK, and perhaps even discover a way to revolutionise the way we think about building.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX provided early stage materials advice to Adrian and his design team to help to realise some of these goals. From the start it was clear that concrete was to be the primary material, but aside from structure, what other functions could concrete take on?<\/p>\n\n<p>Working closely with the CEMEX Research Group in Switzerland, a range of innovative concrete solutions were proposed to Adrian and Graeme during a 2 day workshop. During this time, key principles of thermal and structural design were defined alongside an intensive materials selection process.<\/p>\n\n<p>The design of the structure was centred around cast-in-situ \u2018sandwich panels\u2019, comprising 2 leaves of concrete with a central core of insulating material. This method of solid wall construction has a number of clear advantages including superior air-tightness and significantly reduced thermal conductivity values.<\/p>\n\n<p>Building in this way usually requires <span style=\"color:black\">tons<\/span> of steel reinforcement, cranes to lift formwork <span style=\"color:black\">which<\/span> can take up valuable program time. In order to counter this, CEMEX proposed the use of its <b>Resilia HP<\/b> Fibre-Reinforced Self Compacting Concrete for the structural walls and horizontal elements. Selecting a high-performance fibre-reinforced concrete allowed Adrian\u2019s design team to significantly reduce the amount of steel reinforcement, up to 60% less than in the original design. <b>Resilia HP<\/b> &nbsp;is not only a high strength product, it is also highly ductile, allowing for thinner sections to be cast. This design choice also had an added benefit in speeding up the cycle time between casting of the walls, as there was very little steel to detail and fix. Being a self-compacting concrete (SCC) also meant that the material could be placed into the forms with minimal intervention from the contractor, allowing them to pour each element quicker and more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is widely accepted that concrete performs equally as well as a thermal envelope, providing a great natural method of keeping houses at an even temperature, regardless of the external temperature. But even the most efficient houses can suffer from heat loss at key structural junctions. Following a thorough thermal modelling process assisted by CEMEX Research Group, some key areas of the structure were identified as being prone to heat loss, particularly where horizontal and vertical elements meet. The use of another advanced concrete was proposed to mitigate this. <b>Insularis<\/b>,<b> <\/b>a lightweight concrete, was developed by CEMEX to provide a thermal break in concrete structures. With a much lower thermal conductivity value than traditional concretes, Insularis gives designers the option of continuing the concrete through the junction without compromising on strength or adding in other materials. For Concrete House, <b>Insularis<\/b> was used to form the kickers at the base of the external walls, dealing with the heat loss issues and helping Adrian\u2019s vision of an energy efficient build.<\/p>\n\n<p>Speed and efficiency were also a huge part of the build, and to support this Adrian formed a partnership with Peri UK to use their new Duo® lightweight formwork system. Duo can be assembled by hand in much quicker times, due to its plastic composition and low overall weight. Traditional formworks often require a crane to lift each section into place, an expense not associate with the average self-build project. CEMEX worked closely with Peri and Adrian\u2019s design team to make sure that the <b>Resilia <span style=\"color:black\">HP<\/span> <\/b>concrete would perform well in conjunction with the Duo system. Early site trials were conducted using both brand new products, which allowed CEMEX to optimise the mix design and also improve the production process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Work began on site in September 2017, the site being levelled and foundations being prepared. CEMEX supplied 109m3 of traditional GEN3 concrete for what was probably the most straightforward part of the concrete works. In early November the work to the suspended slabs began in earnest. With a high water table and potential for clay heave, Adrian was forced to adopt additional measures to protect the ground slab, which included a level of steel reinforcement. For this element CEMEX designed the <b>&nbsp;Resilia Conventional<\/b> mix, taking account of the presence of the steel reinforcement and the reduced need for the concrete to perform to a higher flexural strength value. Around 120m3 of <b>Resilia Conventional<\/b> was supplied to form the ground slabs and upstands between level changes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Into December and the first walls were ready to be poured. Due to the layout of the building, Adrian and his build team had to carefully select the build route around the site to avoid conflict between the formwork supports. Smaller sections of walls at low lying parts of the building were completed first, in a methodical sequence which then dictated the speed of build. As the build team became more accustomed to the <b>Resilia HP<\/b>, they were able to place lager volumes per pour.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pouring the walls was not without its share of drama, with the supplying plant being located much further from the project than usually done. This distance caused some early stage issues with logistics and this was made clear when one CEMEX vehicle suffered a puncture whilst travelling to site. The resultant delay in getting the material to site caused a pour line along an external courtyard wall. Fortunately, the <b>Resilia HP<\/b> was designed with four hours of consistence retention, so the material was able to be placed after the short delay with only an aesthetic line on the courtyard wall. Following on from this CEMEX changed the timing and method of production at the plant, allowing more loads to leave for site earlier in the morning to beat the morning rush hour.<\/p>\n\n<p>In January 2018 the first requirement for <b>Insularis<\/b> came around, another first for CEMEX UK to produce. Following trials with assistance from CEMEX Research Group, we prepared to pour the first set of kickers. The first attempt at pumping the material ran into issues, where the concrete would not immediately pump. The decision was taken to hand place the material due to the time limits in place. CEMEX went away and made some modifications to the mix for the second attempt some days later. Again, initially the material blocked the pump, but with some adjustments to the pump configuration the material finally flowed into place. Variations in the raw material alongside the configuration of the pump had caused the issues, but working together with the site team these were overcome.<\/p>\n\n<p>The final structural elements were the roof slabs, where again the levels rose and fell across the building. More upstands and parapets were cast in an intricate sequence of pours planned by Adrian and his team.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once structurally complete there was one more element that required assistance from CEMEX. The final floor construction called for underfloor heating pipes to be laid, with a finished concrete or screed floor. Working with Adrian again, CEMEX proposed a number of options including screeds, but finally it was another concrete which fit the bill. A bespoke version of our <b>Evolution<\/b> Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) was designed to allow a finished concrete surface, without compromising on the floor levels throughout the build and also allowing for a powerfloated finish. The mix, called <b>Evolution F <\/b>contained a range of CEMEX Admixtures which were added to aid the placement of the material whilst controlling the consistence retention to give the contractor time to work with the material.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the completion of the project CEMEX had supplied 4 brand new mix designs all developed and modified to suit the project, with the ongoing assistance of the CEMEX Research Group, the wider CEMEX UK business and related supply chain partners. The project has served as a platform for development of not only new variations of mixes but also the range of applications and sectors which could benefit from utilising these new advances in concrete technology.<\/p>"

Please talk to all drivers about this issue so that they can \u2018see the difference\u2019 too.<\/p>"

It was nominated by CEMEX UK Materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>On announcing the winner at this year\u2019s ceremony on 21 November, guest presenter, broadcaster Huw Edwards said: <em>\u201cThis is a modern masterpiece in concrete design and construction.

The event celebrates excellence in concrete and is one of the longest-running awards programme in the UK construction industry, celebrating its Golden Anniversary this year.<\/p>\n\n<p>Judges from The Concrete Society, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the Institution of Civil Engineers visited all nominated projects \u2013 unique among construction awards programmes. The Outright Winner was unanimously agreed for its technical advancements in the use of concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>Damon Montgomery of CEMEX UK Materials said: <em>\u201cWe are delighted to receive this honour from such a respected body of judges. Without the collective efforts and teamwork of all stakeholders, this project simply would not have been delivered to the exacting quality required. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"A key success factor was the full collaboration between the CEMEX UK Materials integrated supply chain, along with the dedication and organisation of our operations, technical and logistics teams, often delivering high-performance products to the project under significant time pressures. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>\"The result is an iconic structure that we are very proud to have delivered and its use and visibility in the community will, without question, last for many years to come.\u201d<\/em><\/p>"

With one set of processes and a standardised approach, tailored with our business needs in mind, we are better placed to drive continuous improvement across our numerous sites.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis primary authority arrangement makes it easier for us to deliver even more against our environmental policies.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Primary authority partnerships simplify the process of local regulatory compliance by enabling a consistent business-wide approach for businesses that operate across multiple local authority areas. Through them businesses gain a single point of contact for assured advice on meeting certain regulatory standards across their whole operation, rather than separately from each local authority area they work in. It works by requiring local regulators to respect the advice and inspection plans provided to partner businesses by lawful primary authorities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Simon Wilkes, Head of WRS, said: <em>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal in everybody\u2019s best interest. CEMEX takes its compliance responsibilities under these environmental regulations very seriously, and we have the capability and expertise to provide consistent advice to them to be applied at the local level nationwide. Primary authority partnerships like this can save a lot of time and money.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The partnership between CEMEX and WRS covers documentation, procedures, compliance, and inspection plans across all of CEMEX\u2019s activities that are subject to local authority air pollution regulation and require \u2018Part B\u2019 environmental permits, under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to editors:<\/p>\n\n<p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; Elizabeth.young@cemex.com t: 07920 245656<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/li>\n\t<li>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX, leading building materials supplier, working in partnership with energy, services and regeneration group ENGIE, will now be provided with 100% renewable electricity to all supplied sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE has been providing electricity to over 150 CEMEX UK sites for over 10 years, also supplying gas to 33 of these sites. The current contract is to be extended for a further 12 months.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of the electricity supplied to the sites will be from 100% renewable energy sources including wind energy. As these sources produce zero carbon emissions, this makes a significant contribution to reducing CEMEX UK\u2019s carbon footprint. ENGIE\u2019s renewable electricity supply is underpinned by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs).<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE and CEMEX UK\u2019s commitment to renewable electricity is therefore making a positive contribution to the decarbonisation of energy in the UK. In the 2017/2018 financial year, renewable energy made up 34% of ENGIE\u2019s fuel supply mix, compared to 29% nationally.<\/p>\n\n<p>Martin Hills, Head of Energy and Carbon at CEMEX in the UK commented: \u201cCement manufacture is inherently energy-intensive and we work hard to minimise energy consumption within the process constraints. The switch to electricity from renewable sources is playing a key role in our carbon reduction strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is also taking advantage of ENGIE\u2019s demand side services, such as load management to avoid peak tariffs and rapid frequency response, which generates extra revenue for CEMEX UK. ENGIE also manages all contractual requirements with National Grid on CEMEX UK\u2019s behalf.<\/p>\n\n<p>Nicola Lovett, Divisional CEO of Business Energy &amp; Services at ENGIE, observed: \u201cOur 10-year partnership with CEMEX UK has delivered major cost and environmental benefits, while also generating additional revenue for the company. Our ability to provide 100% renewable electricity represents another important step forward in addressing CEMEX UK\u2019s sustainability commitments.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Ends<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>About ENGIE<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE is a leading energy and services company focused on three key activities: production and supply of energy, facilities management and regeneration. Our 17,000 employees combine these capabilities for the benefit of individuals, businesses and communities throughout the UK &amp; Ireland.<\/p>\n\n<p>We enable customers to embrace a lower carbon, more efficient and increasingly digital world. Our customers benefit from our energy efficient and smart building solutions, the provision of effective and innovative services, the transformation of neighbourhoods through regeneration projects, and the supply of reliable, flexible and renewable energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>ENGIE improves lives through better living and working environments. We help to balance performance with responsibility, enabling progress in a harmonious way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Globally, the ENGIE Group employs 150,000 people worldwide and achieved revenues of \u20ac66.6 billion in 2016.<\/p>"

The trucks are DAF 8-wheelers which will carry 20 tonnes of aggregates to be used in construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the first time the safety message includes images of three different groups of vulnerable pedestrians - school children, the not-so-young and Mums with babies and toddlers. The aim is to target the message specifically at these groups. In addition, there is the original image, that of a \u2018generic\u2019 pedestrian.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur trucks are moving billboards and can help us save lives, in this case those of pedestrians. In total we have around 800 vehicles travelling approximately 39 million miles. It\u2019s a great opportunity to use some of these vehicles to spread the message of \u2018Don\u2019t Chance it\u2019, that is don\u2019t step out in front of or close to a large goods vehicle,\u201d comments Dave Hart, Supply Chain Director.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CEMEX Pedestrian safety campaign was launched at the beginning of 2018, following on from their highly successful and market-leading cyclist safety campaign. The company aims to engage with pedestrians to highlight the potential dangers around large goods vehicles and the part pedestrians can play in staying safe.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2016 25% of road fatalities were pedestrians, up 10% compared to 2015 according to the Department of Transport.<\/p>\n\n<p>During 2018 CEMEX has produced a range of materials to inform pedestrians about how to stay safe: a safety leaflet, posters and video available through its website www.cemex.co.uk.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ends<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>For further CEMEX details contact Elizabeth Young; email: Elizabeth.young@cemex.com t: 07920 245656<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>More news stories can be found on Twitter @CEMEX_UK and on our website www.cemex.co.uk<\/li>\n\t<li>Helping to build a Great Britain \u2013 CEMEX\u2019s vision is to help build a greater Britain by providing solutions to construction problems through our innovative building materials, our expertise, our understanding of the construction issues and our people.

        "Body": "<p>This is one of several innovations introduced by Midlands-based concrete mixer supplier, Hymix, working in partnership with building materials supplier, CEMEX. The first truck of its type was on display at the 2019 Concrete Show.<\/p>\n\n<p>The latest innovations focus not only on driver safety but that of vulnerable road users and have been engineered to address the principal concerns of today\u2019s Readymix concrete industry including accidents with falls from height &nbsp;and slips, trips and falls. &nbsp;Other innovations are designed to help reduce the environmental impact.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the new systems reduces emissions by managing the drum speed and engine condition during travelling and at the site. It is possible to make a saving of up to 90% whilst waiting to deliver on site. After delivery the Hymix system provides for self-sufficient wash down and has also introduced a method of neutralizing the pH of the wash water making it harmless and safe to dispose of into the waste water system.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the driver these new developments will reduce their workload allowing them to concentrate on safe driving. Additional safety features help reduce the frequency of rollovers and unplanned incidents whilst the Hymix site light system (SLS) has been extended to improve visibility further in low light conditions and when maneuvering in tight spaces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>James Harper, General Manager at Hymix, said: \u201cImproving safety and helping reduce both serious and minor accidents is a high priority in our vehicle development programme and we aim to work with the industry and key stakeholders to ensure the safety of all involved &nbsp;Our roads are getting busier and potential for danger is greater than ever, it is for everyone in the supply chain to contribute in mitigating risks to all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Charlie Stanford \u2013 National Fleet Liaison Manager at Cemex UK said \u201cWe will one of the first in the industry to take a truck with the new features. The new safety concepts in development at Hymix could reach a global audience and have potential to set a new standard in safety within our Readymixed operations in the UK and beyond\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe first truck to benefit from these innovations plus the latest 360 degree camera system with dynamic views will be on the roads in April.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors<\/p>\n\n<p>Hymix\u2019s new Safety Specification Vehicle includes:<\/p>\n\n<p>Driving Safety<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Improved stability<\/li>\n\t<li>Rollover mitigation aid<\/li>\n\t<li>Drum speed management with Mix Master controls<\/li>\n\t<li>High level stop tail and indicator lamps \u2013 Work lamps triggered on reverse<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Hymix Drum Hold (HDH) prevents unintended drum rotation when undertaking maintenance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Charge Hopper Drop-Down \u2013 combined with the auto-wash facility the ability to lower the charge hopper gives the operator the best possible access for maintaining this area of the mixer unit.

        "Body": "<p>The Leader of North Lincolnshire Council, Cllr Rob Waltham, local MP Andrew Percy, representatives of the Environment Agency, local councillors, CEMEX and the contractors (J P Bentley) met at CEMEX\u2019s South Ferriby plant site to signal the start of the Environment Agency\u2019s £12million scheme.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plan is to build a new impermeable flood embankment west of the CEMEX cement plant on Sluice Road, South Ferriby and make improvements to the north of the A1077 where the embankment will be raised. New brick-clad walls will also be built around Ferriby Sluice.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are delighted to be contributing building materials to construct the new flood defences. In December 2013 floods devasted the CEMEX plant putting it out of production for over 12 months and causing immense damage to local homes and businesses. It was estimated that over £50million worth of damage was caused.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut it is more that the damage itself, the local community, of which we are part, live in fear of a similar event happening again. With the new flood defences we will all have peace of mind,\u201d comments Piotr Klepak, CEMEX Plant Director.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mike Dugher, Deputy Director at the Environment Agency, said: \u201cAfter many years of hard work with our partners, we\u2019re pleased to mark the start of construction on a flood defence that will help protect around 150 homes plus local industry, agriculture, infrastructure and economy. We expect this much-anticipated £12m scheme to be completed by 2021.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>"
