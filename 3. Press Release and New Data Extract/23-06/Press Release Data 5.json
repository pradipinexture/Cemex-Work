        "Body": "<p>The Port of London Authority (PLA) is investing in the new conveyor and infrastructure as part of their Investment Plan. The development will enable CEMEX Marine dredgers to discharge sand and gravel more efficiently for processing at the Northfleet site.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Marine dredgers bring sand and gravel from the North Sea and other off-shore locations into three wharves along the Thames including Northfleet, primarily for use in the London construction market. The site currently handles approximately 500,000 tonnes of material a year, which will increase to approximately 800,000 \u2013 850,000 tonnes with the system due to the faster turn round of vessels.<\/p>\n\n<p>The PLA\u2019s Investment Plan is principally aimed at delivering the goals of the Thames Vision, which targets greater river use, alongside an improving environment. The Plan\u2019s goals are to sustain or increase port trade/river use and generate commercial returns.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur investment at Northfleet is the first under the Investment Plan and is a perfect example of what we are looking to achieve,\u201d explained PLA chief executive, Robin Mortimer. \u201cWe are financing the improved discharge systems that will marry up well with the new dredger that CEMEX has on order. In combination this will secure the long term future of cargo handling at this key site and generate a commercial return which we can re-invest in other river projects.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Marine Director, Kurt Cowdrey comments \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to partner with the PLA to improve cargo handling on the Thames. London is an important market for us and this investment will provide a platform for continued use and future growth at Northfleet.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe capital needs approximately 10 million tonnes* of sand, gravel and crushed rock every year to build, maintain and improve housing, buildings and infrastructure. The use of water to transport building materials to the heart of the city reduces the need for long distance lorry movements, with every dredger reducing the need for 250 lorries on our busy roads.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The new dry discharge system will be completed mid to end June 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\u2013 ends \u2013<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Date: 22nd April 2019 Earth Day, a global celebration of our planet, is celebrated in more than 193 countries by over a billion people. This year as part of the Earth Day celebrations, CEMEX Europe colleagues specializing in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) will be holding workshops for school children at schools near CEMEX operations. The theme of the workshops will be to support one of the main Earth Day\u2019s principles, to help end plastic pollution.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is expected that the workshops will increase the environmental awareness of this significant topic by encouraging pupils to learn about recycling and upcycling as a method of transforming plastic waste into usable objects.<\/p>\n\n<p>2.5 billion tons of waste are generated in EU countries every year, according to the European Commission. The key reasons for this waste are the result of excessive consumption, over production and ill-informed buying habits without consideration of the longevity and durability of products.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is committed to minimizing the impact of its operations on the environment and to ensure it is the best possible neighbor in the communities in which it operates. Izabella Rokicka Communications and CSR Director, CEMEX Europe comments \u201cAs a company we develop products and building solution to build more sustainable construction and infrastructure which communities need. At the same time, we aim to work with those communities to provide solutions that improve the quality of life for all.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis project aims to educate young people in a fun and innovative way about waste and how they can help tackle some of the environmental issues that we face. Hopefully it will encourage them to challenge the throw-away culture, as well as reduce the amount of waste that is generated going forward. This is the first pan-European activity and it\u2019s a great start to future projects.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>The workshops will be held throughout 2019 in the seven European countries where the company operates: UK, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and Croatia. The workshops will be organized in cooperation with local schools, and run jointly with local social partners specializing in recycling and upcycling.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services to customers and communities in more than 50 countries.

        "Body": "<p>Cambusmore quarry in northern Scotland was the most diverse of all sites surveyed, with 200 species recorded in total. This included 15 Red List birds, six protected mammals and 66 flowering plants. There were regular sightings of pine martens, ospreys, Atlantic salmon, otters and high numbers of red squirrel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Raynes quarry in north Wales is the most improved site, with a total of 132 recorded species. The creation of a wildflower meadow has been successful, with 87 different varieties of flowering plant spotted, including several types of orchid. This has in turn attracted many different butterflies and moths, such as ringlet, small heath, common blue, dingy skipper, dark green fritillary and cinnabar moth. There are plans for goats to be used to graze the wildflower meadow in Autumn as a natural method of scrub control.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The survey has been relaunched for the coming year, with the aim to expand it across the UK, covering all 35 quarries. This monitoring is vital as it helps to inform and develop the Biodiversity Action Plans at each site; assessing how activities such as planting wildflower meadows, wetland creation or installation of bat boxes are doing, and highlighting areas for potential improvement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Sean Cassidy, Regional Environmental Manager for Sustainability, commented: <em>\u201cEncouraging biodiversity across our business locations is a priority for CEMEX and this initiative has demonstrated the success of these efforts. It\u2019s a great opportunity to reflect on the work completed so far and consider how it can be developed further, while also encouraging our teams to get involved and appreciate the wildlife for themselves.

Richard Grant, Site Manager for Knights Brown, explained: \u201cThe wind turbine base was a bit unusual as it was cast entirely above ground and located within a busy 24-hour a day wine processing plant. The C50 Concrete mix design was also out of the ordinary with the inclusion of fibres and admixtures.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe 660m³ concrete pour was well planned out and executed. It went better than we even anticipated as we were able to supply two concrete pumps with over 100 deliveries in a under 10 hours. The wine processing plant remained fully functional with minimum disruption throughout the day. The end clients on this project were very impressed with the professionalism of all of those involved on the day.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Go uses the latest digital-industrial technology available through desktops and mobile devices to allow customers to place orders, track shipments, manage invoices and make payments for CEMEX\u2019s building products including bagged and bulk cement, readymixed concrete and aggregates.

        "Body": "<ul style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\">\n\t<li>Energy Vault\u2019s transformative energy storage technology solves a key challenge for renewables, which have struggled to replace, in a significant manner, fossil fuel power due to production unpredictability and intermittency of wind and sunlight. Consequently, energy storage solutions that can harness energy from renewable sources become vital if cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy are sought.<\/li>\n\t<li>In the absence of longer duration and more cost-effective energy storage, the amount of electricity that can be delivered to the grid from renewable energy sources, even though now widely affordable, has been limited.<\/li>\n\t<li>For the first time, Energy Vault\u2019s system enables renewables to deliver baseload power below the cost of fossil fuels 24 hours a day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This investment follows a previously announced technology partnership with CEMEX to provide concrete and other composite material technology for Energy Vault\u2019s storage towers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Energy Vault\u2019s breakthrough technology was inspired by pumped hydro plants that rely on the power of gravity and the movement of water to store and discharge electricity. This solution is based on the same well-understood principles of physics and mechanical engineering used in those plants. Energy Vault\u2019s system replaces water with custom made concrete bricks through an innovative use of low-cost materials. The massive bricks are combined with its patented system design and proprietary algorithm-based software to operate a newly designed crane. The crane orchestrates the energy storage tower and electricity charge/discharge while accounting for a variety of factors, including energy supply and demand volatility, weather elements and other variables such as inertia and system deflection.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result, Energy Vault can deliver all the benefits of a gravity-based pumped hydro system with lower price, higher round trip efficiency, without the requirement for specific land topographies and negative environmental or wildlife impacts. Importantly, with Energy Vault\u2019s longer duration and more cost-effective energy storage, electricity from renewables can be delivered for less than the price of fossil fuels 24 hours a day for the first time. In April 2019, Energy Vault won the World Changing Idea Award from Fast Company in the Energy category for the unprecedented economic and environmental benefits its technology provides.<\/p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cEnergy storage that enables power to be delivered for less than the cost of fossil fuels is critical as the world shifts away from its reliance on carbon-based fuels to renewable energy,\u201d<\/i> said Gonzalo Galindo, CEO of CEMEX Ventures. <i>\u201cEnergy Vault\u2019s storage technology is transformational, and we\u2019re extremely pleased to broaden our relationship and support the company\u2019s efforts. The investment is also important because it complements the CEMEX R&amp;D partnership and will accelerate our corporate objectives to achieve a carbon-free industrial footprint.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cCEMEX is a key strategic partner that adds critical innovations in material science that enhance both the economics and longevity of our energy storage system, and we\u2019re thrilled to expand our partnership to welcome CEMEX Ventures as an investor,\u201d said Robert Piconi, chief executive officer and co-founder, Energy Vault. \u201cThe combination of CEMEX\u2019s smart concrete solutions, significant global infrastructure and now its strategic investment will accelerate our ability to enable renewable energy to replace fossil fuels 24 hours a day.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n\n<p>For more information on Energy Vault, please visit energyvault.ch<\/p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2017, CEMEX Ventures focuses on helping overcome the main challenges and capitalizing on the opportunity areas in the construction ecosystem through sustainable solutions.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX and GB Railfreight (GBRf) presented the new CEMEX-liveried locomotive at a dedicated naming ceremony held at Dove Holes Quarry, Buxton.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe new locomotive is called The Cemex Express. The name was unveiled at the event by record producer and rail enthusiast Pete Waterman. Resplendent in the white, blue and red colours of the CEMEX brand, the vehicle recognises the partnership between GBRf and CEMEX, which has now been in place for one year.<br />\nThe Cemex Express, a Class 66 Locomotive, will travel typically between Dove Holes quarry, carrying premium aggregate for our readymix and asphalt plants, and external customers throughout the UK. It will pull 22 to 26 hopper wagons that discharge their loads from underneath directly onto the plant\u2019s conveyors. A single trainload can deliver up to 2,000 tons of material in one trip and will make over 200 trips for CEMEX each year; the equivalent of over 20,000 truckloads.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nDavid Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK &amp; France, commented: \u201cThe transport of our product by rail is of ever-increasing importance to CEMEX as we look to make our operations as sustainable as possible. Rail is a far more environmentally friendly method of transport than trucks on the road, as a train burns significantly less fuel per ton-mile than road vehicles, saving around 50% in CO2 emissions.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX UK currently transports 2.6 million tonnes of aggregate by rail each year which equates to approximately 100,000 trucks off the road; enough to build 40,000 houses; and we want to continue to build on this. We are very proud of our partnership with GBRf and hope that together we will be able to transport more and more by rail safely whilst reducing the number of truck movements.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nLex Russell, Managing Director for UK Materials North at CEMEX, added: \u201cDove Holes is one of CEMEX\u2019s most important quarries and generates several million tonnes of limestone aggregates every year, as well as asphalt, readymix, concrete products and dry silo mortar. &nbsp;By rail we then supply many locations across the UK including key cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham and London.<br />\n\u201cIt was therefore the perfect location to unveil The Cemex Express locomotive and take the opportunity to thank those in our team and at GBRf for their hard work and dedication to our rail partnership.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nJohn Smith, Managing Director of GBRf, said \u201cWe are delighted to unveil this fantastic Class 60 locomotive, painted in the CEMEX livery and representing our two organisations\u2019 ongoing partnership. This contract is demonstrative of the role rail freight has to play in helping the UK to cut carbon emissions and to improve air quality.&nbsp;<br />\nOn average, one gallon of fuel will move one tonne of goods 246 miles on the rail network, while the same amount will only get you 88 miles by road. Rail freight\u2019s CO2 emissions are 76 per cent lower than road\u2019s, per tonne carried. An average freight train removes 60 HGV journeys from the roads and the largest up to 160. When this is combined with rail\u2019s advantageous performance in terms of nitrous oxide and particulate matter emissions, rail freight demonstrates a clear contribution to the challenge of meeting the UK\u2019s carbon-cutting targets.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:&nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide. In this country, we are a leading provider of aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete and rail sleepers with annual sales of around £1 billion.<\/p>\n\n<p>For further CEMEX details please contact Sarah Murphy; email: <a href=\"mailto:sarah.murphy@cemex.com\">sarah.murphy@cemex.com<\/a>&nbsp;or call&nbsp;07557 319972<\/p>"

The inclusion of a central mixer also enables special products such as traditional sand cement screed and flowing screeds like Supaflo to be produced, increasing the product range available.&nbsp;<br />\nAs the plant is sited directly in the quarry, it means materials will no longer have to be transported from the Bramshill to Eversley by truck, dramatically decreasing the number of trucks on local roads and offering substantial eco advantages. With only cement now needed to be brought in, it is believed this will equate to 10 lorries less each day on the road.&nbsp;<br />\nThe plant will have a storage capacity of 300 tonnes of cement, and 240 tonnes of aggregates. CEMEX will be now able to increase production from 24m/h (at the existing Eversley plant) to 80m/h, while using a wet batch plant will ensure a better quality and strength of mix.<br />\nPeter Hawker, Operations Manager at CEMEX, commented: \u201cThis is a long-term investment by CEMEX into the Bramshill Quarry that will generate considerable benefits for our customers and the environment, for years to come.

D Heathcote covered the most distance in 60 minutes \u2013 45.19kms and H Gill covered the most distance in two one hour stints \u2013 83.76kms. J Berry managed an incredible 20.21kms using his hands and arms because he had recently had an operation on a delicate part of his body.&nbsp;Roger Taylor, Operations Manager for DSM, remarked he could not believe the commitment and effort every one of the volunteers put in to complete this event.<\/p>\n\n<p>They had a couple of malfunctions along the way: a bike wouldn\u2019t record the distance being travelled but luckily the company they hired the bikes from were quick to respond and brought them a replacement within three hours, and they also had a trouser malfunction but the less said about that the better!<\/p>\n\n<p>The Dove Holes team didn\u2019t only manage to get from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats, but they got over half way back again by completing an astonishing 2,296.62kms, that is an average of 35kms for each person.

        "Body": "<p>The collaboration has seen significant progress at both working and restored quarries. The summer months offer the best opportunity for spotting butterfly species at our sites. However, butterflies face many challenges with two thirds of species now showing population declines nationally. &nbsp;Butterflies are under threat due to a variety of reasons including climate change and extreme weather events, habitat destruction, intensive agricultural techniques, loss of wildflower meadows, wetland drainage schemes, removal of hedgerows and woodland clearance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite these clear pressures on butterfly populations, research by Butterfly Conservation has proven that with careful habitat design and habitat management, sites can mitigate against these events. CEMEX is at the forefront of implementing recommendations on their restored sites and have already had tremendous success in reversing population trends. &nbsp;Other land owners are now following their example with a definite feeling that we are turning the tide on the population declines.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Warwickshire with the help of Butterfly Conservation CEMEX was instrumental in first saving the Small Blue butterfly from regional extinction, but not content with this then reversed its fortunes. From the original three remaining Small Blue colonies which were all under threat, the number of colonies has now grown to 23, many of the colonies on CEMEX or former CEMEX sites. Warwickshire now has more colonies recorded than ever before. &nbsp;The work in Warwickshire has also helped conserve other rare butterflies including the Grizzled and Dingy Skippers, Dark Green Fritillary and Chalk Carpet Moth.<\/p>\n\n<p>Newly found<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Northumberland RSPB and CEMEX are working together at Divethill quarry preserving and creating the rare habitat called Whin grassland. &nbsp;During 2019 the Small Pearl-Bordered Fritillary was found on site. This was good news as the species is an important pollinator for the wildflower assemblage found in the grassland. Future restoration at the site will increase the area of rare grassland and include the addition of important native woodland fringes. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sandgate quarry, Blue Adonis \u2013 The Blue Adonis is one of the UK\u2019s rarest butterflies and is found in only a few colonies doted along the south east coast. The butterfly has very specific requirements for its habitat including well cropped grass on a south facing meadow. &nbsp;The meadow also needs to support the butterfly\u2019s host plant which is Horseshoe Vetch. &nbsp;As part of the restoration work at Sandgate a habitat has been created that perfectly matches these requirements. With a colony already established at the nearby Cissbury Ring we have been lucky enough to attract this rare species to our site. During May 2019, a healthy population was discovered on site. Key measures going forward are to preserve the habitat and ensure the colony is protected. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopeful colonisers<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Raynes quarry in Wales is adjacent to Mynydd Marian SSSI which is home to a rare colony of Silver Studded Blue. RSPB and CEMEX have implemented a Biodiversity Action Plan to focus restoration work on habitat creation to improve the site for a bird species called the Chough, Wildflowers and the Silver-studded Blue butterfly. The quarry is developing a habitat called Calcareous grassland on restored areas of the site. This work has been ongoing for a number of years and utilised hay from the SSSI as a source of grass and wildflower seeds. The butterfly\u2019s main food plant is Common Rock Rose, which is now found on site. &nbsp;Surveys are carried out annually. &nbsp;To date, 2019 has shown that there are over 80 species flowering plant found in the grassland which already supports large and abundant butterfly populations. Some of the species found at the quarry this year included the Small White, Gatekeeper, Ringlet, Small Heath and also the Shaded Broad Bar Moth. The focus now is to encourage the Silver Studded Blue to site. The Chough continues to use the site for nesting and rearing its young during the summer months. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ancient woodland that flanks CEMEX Newbridge quarry in North Yorkshire is rich in Flora and Fauna and it is also home to the most northerly population of Duke of Burgundy, a tiny pretty butterfly whose food plant, Cowslip, grows in the areas of open woodland. Restoration has encouraged Cowslips to colonise the grassland-wood fringe and we are hopeful the Duke of Burgundy will follow soon.<\/p>"

The facility in Tilbury currently has approximately 2,800 employees but is set to increase to over 4,000. The Amazon KIVA robots are in operation at the facility and it was a joy to see how the robot was used. It was also interesting to hear that the robots were not a direct replacement for people but actually have created a requirement to employ more due to the efficiency of the robots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some key principles of the robot use were to improve storage effectiveness with a greater utilisation of floor space; by using the KIVA robot Amazon were able to store 40% more inventory. The CEMEX team were very interested to see how the health and safety was part of the robotic innovation. It was obvious that manual movements had been removed from this area of the process, eliminating all the risk associated with manual handling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Isolation was remarkably a lot more high-tech, the need for engineers to have access to the area where the robots were moving was essential due to the size of the facility. All engineering staff that required access, of which only two were trained per floor per shift, are issued a special type of vest which has an imbedded sensor, this sensor is picked up by any KIVA robot within five metres of the engineer and will immediately stop, once the engineer moves the KIVA robot will commence on its planned route.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Terence Clair, Operations Manager for Rail Solutions UK, said: \u201cIt was good to discuss some of the challenges faced around health and safety, with peoples\u2019 behaviours being a top topic for them much like ourselves. It is important to know that we choose to do things every day that have an impact or consequence, however, if we can think safety before we process the action we will reduce behavioural related accidents.\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Thanks to the conveyor belt bed in the trailer, there is no need for the truck to tip the clay out, which ensures there is no risk of truck rollover or collision with buildings if the body is not lowered. In addition, the driver can control the process by remote control from inside the cab \u2013 further increasing safety and minimising potential risk.<br />\nUsing these trailers also ensures a steady flow of clay from the truck into the reception hopper, reducing stress on the reception hopper and feeder. The belt trailer is also proven to discharge a load in the same amount of time as traditional tipper trucks.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, air vents in the trailer prevent the clay from sweating, while the stainless-steel body ensures a clean discharge of material, without any clay sticking.&nbsp;<br />\nBMD Transport, who were awarded a five-year contract with CEMEX to haul clay, has initially purchased two trucks from Fruehauf with plans to acquire an additional seven over the next year and replace the whole existing fleet for this route with the new models.&nbsp;<br />\nWhen the whole fleet has changed to these vehicles, there are further potential benefits; it could reduce the time to discharge each load, as drivers will not have to wait for the preceding load to have cleared the reception hopper before they start to deliver their load. This could then mean that CEMEX can increase the amount of clay brought from Southam each day.<br />\nLee Needham, Inbound Manager for UK Cement Operations at CEMEX, commented: \u201cWhen BMD presented these new trucks to us, we knew they would be a very positive addition to our fleet. Ensuring the safety of those who work for us and on our sites is of vital importance to CEMEX, and we are always looking for ways to improve our operation. These vehicles offer a very obvious safety benefit and meet FORS Silver standard, plus are also efficient and reliable. We look forward to working with BMD to replace the remainder of the fleet.\u201d<br />\nDec Chokar, Director at BMD Transport, added: \u201cThese new trucks are state of the art and have been specifically designed to be used for transporting clay. Eliminating the risk of truck rollover at point of discharge is of considerable benefit to CEMEX and will help to ensure they run a market-leading, safe operation.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:center\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">\u2013 ends \u2013<\/span><\/span> <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Notes to Editors:<\/span><\/span><\/b><b> <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">About CEMEX<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li class=\"paragraph\" style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:list 36.0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

It provides real-time pricing during the design process to reduce cost<br />\nuncertainty and wasteful redesign efforts. It also standardizes material selection and works directly<br />\nwith suppliers to procure materials, eliminating submittals and lead-time delays. Their in-house<br />\nsoftware helps to manage the process end-to-end, simplifying the complexities of construction and<br />\nautomating most of the construction administration and accounting process.<br />\nAlthough X3 Builders was founded just over a year ago, the startup\u2019s employees boast vast<br />\nexperience in both the construction industry and the entrepreneurial world. The company started<br />\nout by exploring payment automation processes, and it went on to further develop its solution to<br />\ninclude the automation of the complete construction management process. Thanks to the team\u2019s<br />\nextensive experience in the field, they have been able to incorporate solutions to everyday needs.<br />\nBy having more data readily available and controlling the pre-construction phase, it\u2019s possible to<br />\nsimplify many of the subsequent processes in the project\u2019s life cycle and to reduce overall project<br />\ncosts. That is why so many property owners are willing to try this end-to-end solution, relying on the<br />\ntransparency and regional pricing data offered by X3 Builders.

        "Body": "<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first lorry safety scheme of its kind launches in London this week<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Direct Vision Standard seeks to eliminate dangerous Heavy Goods Vehicle blind spots, proven to be the cause of pedestrian and cyclist deaths and serious injuries<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HGVs that fail to meet new minimum safety standards will be issued a penalty charge for driving in the capital.<br />\nSadiq visited CEMEX\u2019s Stepney Concrete Plant today to see DVS lorries in action. All of the vehicles that CEMEX operates in London meet or exceed the minimum DVS requirements in place until 2024.<br />\n&nbsp;The first of its kind, the Direct Vision Standard tackles road danger at its source by minimising HGV blind spots which contribute to many tragic deaths and life-changing injuries. Based on how much a driver can see directly through their cab windows, the &nbsp;unique star system rates HGVs over 12 tonnes from zero (lowest) to five (highest). HGVs will need to meet a minimum \u2018one-star\u2019 rating by the time enforcement begins to enable them to operate in London, or will need to fit \u2018Safe System\u2019 measures to improve the vehicle\u2019s safety.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;Big lorries are disproportionately involved in fatal collisions. Whilst they account for just four per cent of the overall miles driven in the capital, between 2015 and 2017, HGVs were involved in 63 per cent of fatal collisions involving cyclists and 25 per cent involving pedestrians.<br />\n&nbsp;From this week, operators can apply for a HGV Safety Permit ahead of enforcement beginning on 26 October 2020. HGV operators who fail to meet these new minimum safety standards and obtain a permit will be issued a penalty charge for driving in the capital. The Direct Vision Standard will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will be enforced within the Greater London Boundary.&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:<\/strong> \u201cI\u2019m proud of our world-leading plans to remove the most dangerous lorries from London\u2019s streets. So many of the tragic deaths on our roads involve HGVs and this new scheme will help save lives.<br />\n\u201cForward-looking businesses have already been choosing safer vehicles in the run up to HGV safety permits becoming available. Today the scheme has gone live and operators now have 12 months to upgrade their fleets, helping make our streets much safer for people walking and cycling.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>David Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK, commented:<\/strong> \u201cWe were honoured to welcome Sadiq Khan and the TfL team to our Stepney site today, as the Direct Vision Standard is launched. DVS is a landmark scheme that will ensure that all road users and pedestrians are safe as they come across HGVs while moving around the city. We fully support the programme; safety is CEMEX\u2019s number one priority and informs all aspects of our operation.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are committed to investing in, and developing, our fleet so that it continues to reflect the latest advancements in safety features. In the UK, we are proud to be a FORS Gold operator and compliant with the CLOCS standard, and are just as committed to the Direct Vision Standard for HGVs. We look forward to continuing to work with the Mayor, TfL and London councils for safer roads and streets here in London and beyond.\u201d<br />\nOwners of vehicles rated zero-star will need to improve the overall safety of their vehicle by fitting a \u2018Safe System\u2019 to reduce the risk it presents to people walking, cycling and riding motorcycles before enforcement begins. These include a camera monitoring system, a noise alert when turning left and sensors. Fitting the \u2018Safe System\u2019 will not improve a vehicle's DVS star rating but will bring the safety standard of the vehicle up to allow operators to apply for a Safety Permit.<br />\n&nbsp;TfL worked closely with manufacturers, operators and stakeholders - including RoadPeace and Living Streets - to develop the Direct Vision Standard.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;At the same time as the Direct Vision Standard is brought into force, requirements for the London-wide Low Emission Zone will be tightened so that heavy vehicles across the capital are subject to the tough ULEZ standards. These changes show the vital role the freight industry will play in both tackling road danger and cleaning up the capital\u2019s toxic air. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Christina Calderato, Head of Transport Strategy and Planning, said: <\/strong>\u201cToday we have reached a major milestone in a scheme that will save people\u2019s lives and play a significant role in helping us achieve Vision Zero. Transforming the safety of HGVs will dramatically reduce road danger for people walking and cycling, helping us to ensure that everyone gets home safely every day. We would like to encourage all operators to check the star rating of their vehicles and take action today, by applying for a permit or fitting a Safe System.\u201d<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Councillor Julian Bell, Chair of the London Councils Transport and Environment Committee, said: <\/strong>&nbsp;\u201cLondon boroughs support the launch of Direct Vision Standard Safety Permits for HGVs using London\u2019s roads. This is a huge step forward for road safety in the capital. &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\u201cEnsuring lorry drivers have good levels of visibility will better protect vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. Increasing the number of people who walk and cycle in the capital is vital to improving our air quality and reducing congestion. We look forward to the new scheme having a positive impact on the safety of London\u2019s road network.\u201d &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Victoria Lebrec, Campaign Coordinator for RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said: <\/strong>\u201cI lost my leg in a crash with a lorry in 2014 because the driver didn\u2019t see me. Since then there have been many people killed and even more seriously injured because the lorries currently driving on London roads are not fit for purpose. It is madness to have huge, heavy vehicles with poor visibility on roads that are filled with people. Transport for London should be commended for their Safety Permit scheme. I look forward to October 2020 when the most dangerous vehicles will be off the roads \u2013 and in the meantime encourage operators to consider thinking ahead, and making their vehicles five stars.\u201d<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Stephen Edwards, Director of Policy and Communications, Living Streets said:<\/strong> \"Despite making up just four per cent of London\u2019s motor traffic, HGVs are involved in more than a fifth of pedestrian fatalities. The threat they pose to our safety has not been acceptable for a long time.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\u201cThe Direct Vision Standard is a much-needed scheme which stands to save many lives. By implementing this world-first innovation, the Mayor of London demonstrates his commitment to creating a city safer for walking and ensures London remains one of the world\u2019s leading cities.\u201d<br />\nLoughborough University researchers have been instrumental in bringing the Direct Vision Standard to where it is today, having defined and tested the scheme. &nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Dr Steve Summerskill, Senior Lecturer at Loughborough University, said: <\/strong>\u201cThis successful project is the result of the efforts of a number of staff in the Loughborough Design School, who have worked as a team to produce an innovate and accurate testing technique that has been validated by vehicle manufacturers. The result will have a beneficial effect on the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in the UK capital and further afield. An impact assessment performed by TRL (Transport Research Laboratory) on behalf of the EU showed that European adoption would save hundreds of lives per year.\u201d<br />\nTfL is working with the UK Government, European Commission and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to develop international regulations on vehicle design standards.&nbsp;<br />\nThe Direct Vision Standard is part of TfL's Vision Zero commitment to tackle the number of people being killed and seriously injured on London's roads.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information please contact Sarah Murphy at <a href=\"mailto:sarah.murphy@cemex.com\">sarah.murphy@cemex.com<\/a>&nbsp;or 07557 319972<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>It was named as the overall winner of the Planned Biodiversity-led Restoration category.<br />\nThe MPA praised the plan as a fantastic example of progressive restoration of a rock quarry to create an attractive landform and a mosaic of species-rich, locally important and distinctive \u2018Whin\u2019 grassland, agricultural grassland, woodland and hedges, and open water. The judges were impressed by the clear plan to deliver a range of habitats and realise the unique opportunity presented by quarrying to deliver regional priorities and wider landscape-scale benefits.<br />\nDonald Wilkins, Development Planner, said: \u201cThrough early engagement with the Northumberland Wildlife Trust, the RSPB, Northumberland County Council and Magnificent Meadows, it was clear that the restoration at Divethill Quarry provided an opportunity to create new areas of species rich grasslands and whin grasslands, both of which have been in decline over the past few decades.\u201d<br />\n\u201cCEMEX is delighted to have won the \u2018Planned Biodiversity-led Restoration\u2019 and will continue to work with our partner organisations to maximise the benefits from the restoration of our quarries.\u201d<br />\nThe restoration plan is to create a grassland with whin ridge/escarpment and outcrops (locally named as \u2018heughs\u2019) within a mosaic of species-rich grasslands with subtly varying soil types. Additionally, native woodland to the south and a small waterbody will add diversity and act as a hub for wildlife (both local and on passage). Whin grasslands are closely associated with the \u2018Great Whin Sill\u2019 a quartz dolerite intrusion upon which Hadrian\u2019s Wall is located.<br />\nThe thin soils found there are base-rich but nutrient-poor and prone to drought, which has led to the development of a species-rich sward, a composite of both acid- and alkali-loving plants. Whole hosts of specialist wildflowers and numerous red listed upland birds and mammals and national scarce species can be found; maiden pink, wild onion, biting stonecrop, common rock-rose, wild thyme, salad burnet, the locally scarce small-flowered and long-stalked crane\u2019s-bills. Birds and mammals include brown hare, peregrine, yellowhammer, linnet, curlew and whinchat.<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX decided to collaborate with the RSPB in 2009 because of the organisation\u2019s huge conservation knowledge, experience and expertise, and scale and willingness to work in a trusted partnership, to lead the industry in terms of biodiversity and conservation efforts.<br />\nThis relationship prioritised the conservation of rare and endangered species on CEMEX land. Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) are now in place at high priority CEMEX sites, with new projects being started at other quarries.&nbsp;<br />\nThese BAPs incorporate varied actions that improve ecosystem services and create space for rewilding, presenting opportunities for working alongside NGOs to develop species rich habitats.<br />\nAlongside the 1000 hectares of restored habitat, other achievements of the partnership so far have included work at four central England sites to create habitat and a sustainable food source for the turtle dove, which is the country\u2019s fastest-declining bird species; and efforts to protect the rare red-billed chough at its Raynes quarry.<br />\nStandout restoration projects have received nationwide acclaim, such as the Rugeley heathland and Lade Pits quarry in Kent.<br />\nCEMEX will continue to work closely with the RSPB towards a series of further targets for priority species conservation and priority habitat creation. The company will also work on improved engagement and awareness with employees, customers and communities.&nbsp;<br />\nAndy Spencer, VP of Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX Europe said: \u201cWe are very proud of our partnership with the RSPB, and what has been achieved over the last 10 years. Not only have we restored a considerable amount of priority habitat across the country together, two years ahead of schedule, but we have also helped a number of rare species.<br />\n\u201cConservation is one of the key parts of our ongoing sustainability strategy and this partnership is critical for us to delivery ongoing net gain in biodiversity across our extraction sites so when we complete our work, we are giving more back to society and the environment than was there to start with.<br />\n\u201cIn the future, the partnership needs to continue to deliver high quality, high priority habitats to help combat the decline in biodiversity that we\u2019ve seen in the UK, as well as strengthen our partnership into ongoing advocacy and supporting each other to achieve our common goals. We are excited to see what we can achieve together over the next 10 years!\u201d<br />\nBeccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, commented: \u201cWorking in partnership with CEMEX we have shown how land can be transformed from being an active quarry into a vibrant home for wildlife and we hope that our experience inspires others to play their part in restoring nature.<br />\n\u201cOur natural world is in crisis, but by restoring or creating habitats we can often reverse local population declines of threatened species, keeping our common species common and expanding the number of safe havens our wildlife needs across the UK.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cIn addition to providing urgently needed new habitat for threatened species the former quarry sites are also providing communities with accessible green spaces and connecting people to nature. Together we are delivering practical examples of how the way we manage our land can see nature return. &nbsp;Going forward we will continue to demonstrate how business and conservation can work together to make a positive difference and ensure the variety of our wonderful species can be sustained in a way which also benefits people.\u201d<br />\nThe anniversary of the partnership was celebrated at Petersham Nurseries in Covent Garden.

They often spend an hour or two on a quarry pond or in a restored wetland before moving off to the coast to feed on salt marsh and coastal farmland. These birds spend the winter moving between estuaries in the east and west, traveling from The Wash to the Forth of Firth and always flying in that classic aerodynamic V formation.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nImage credit: Tim Melling<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The rating upgrade reflects CEMEX\u2019s improvement in governance, risk management, CO2 emissions reduction initiatives, low carbon products, and value chain engagement.<br />\n\"We are very pleased not only that our CDP score has improved, but also that it reflects our company\u2019s continued effort to achieve a robust climate change strategy, which is helping us to reduce our operations\u2019 CO2 footprint. So far, we have reduced our net specific emissions per ton of cementitious product by more than 22% when compared to our 1990 baseline, putting us on track to accomplish our ambitious science-based targets for 2030,\u201d said Vicente Saiso, Corporate Sustainability Director of CEMEX.<br />\nTo date, CEMEX has reduced its direct CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious product by more than 22% compared to its 1990 baseline, allowing the company to avoid approximately 8 million tons of CO2 during 2019, equivalent to the carbon emissions of 1.6 million passenger vehicles.<br />\nCEMEX is taking the following steps to further reduce its direct CO2 emissions:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Producing new types of low CO2 clinker, cement, and concrete products<\/li>\n\t<li>Increasing our use of alternative fuels as a substitute for fossil fuels<\/li>\n\t<li>Using waste from other industries as alternative raw materials as a substitute for clinker<\/li>\n\t<li>Expanding and protecting natural carbon sinks from our El Carmen Nature Reserve to all of our quarries<\/li>\n\t<li>Developing and testing disruptive technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and other innovative carbon technologies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>CEMEX is also determined to reduce indirect CO2 emissions from electricity through the company\u2019s use of renewable energy. Close to 30% of CEMEX\u2019s power consumption is covered by renewable energy sources, the highest rate among global cement companies.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nCDP is a not-for-profit international organization that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. Over the past 15 years, CDP has created a system that has resulted in unparalleled engagement on environmental issues worldwide.

        "Summary": "A new, £3.8million dry discharge system at CEMEX\u2019s Northfleet Wharf in Kent has been officially opened. The building materials supplier partnered with the Port of London Authority on the investment, which will ensure a more sustainable and flexible operation.",

        "Display Title": "CEMEX and PLA Officially Open New Dry Discharge System at Northfleet Wharf",
        "Body": "<p>Following this investment CEMEX\u2019s marine dredgers, which bring sand and gravel from CEMEX\u2019s licensed offshore locations in the North Sea and the English Channel into Northfleet, will be able to arrive fully laden for the first time. This will increase capacity of the site by approximately 350,000 tonnes per year to between 800,000 and 850,000 tonnes.<br />\nThis will allow CEMEX to provide more material to its on-site building products plant, reducing the need for aggregates to be transported in from other locations. This offers considerable sustainability benefits, as every dredger load reduces the need for 250 lorries on the region\u2019s busy roads.&nbsp;<br />\nPrior to this investment, the wharf at Northfleet was the only wet discharge system remaining in CEMEX\u2019s UK portfolio, and was prone to blockages and limited the products and capacity that could be brought into site. The new dry discharge system will increase the reliability and flexibility of the wharf, reducing the risk of blockages and ensuring ships can bring in exactly the right materials needed. The site can therefore better balance stocks and ensure quality, providing CEMEX\u2019s customers with an improved service.&nbsp;<br />\nLaurence Dagley, CEMEX UK Materials South\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cWe are grateful for our positive relationship with the PLA, and thankful for their support. Not only will this investment allow us to better serve the London market, opening up opportunities for growth and securing the future of the wharf, but it also promises a considerable sustainability benefit by taking trucks off the road.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCEMEX\u2019s UK strategy focuses on London and the other metropolitan markets across the country, as we believe increasing urbanisation will drive greater demand growth in these markets. It is therefore vital that our sites in these areas are developed to ensure they can support this strategy.<br />\n\u201cThanks to the funding from PLA, we have been able to invest our own resources into other assets, such as CEMEX Go Innovation, our state-of-the-art marine dredger which will arrive in the UK later this year.\u201d<br />\nRobin Mortimer, PLA chief executive, said: \u201cThis investment is central to our long-term Thames Vision work to maximise the use of tidal river between Teddington and the coast, for both freight and passenger transport.<br />\n\u201cOur aim is to do this whilst also protecting the environment and making the most of the river\u2019s social and recreational potential. Crucially, this conveyor also generates a commercial return for us, which we will be re-invest in other projects to enhance the river, for the benefit of all its users and the environment at large.\u201d<br />\nLocal MP Adam Holloway attended the opening event, commenting: \u201cIt is genuinely an honour to cut the ribbon on this wonderful project, which is such a great collaboration between the PLA and CEMEX. The river has always been a mainstay of Gravesham\u2019s economy and this very welcome new investment is vital to protecting its future as a source of employment for local people. It\u2019s also contributing towards the work the nation needs to undertake to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.<br />\n\u201cI congratulate both the PLA and CEMEX for showing such leadership on this issue.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

I facilitated idea generation and helped steer each group to work together to present their idea.\u201d<br />\nJazz continues: \u201cThese sessions are incredibly rewarding for the students and business mentors. I cannot express enough the satisfaction I get from the various events. &nbsp;They provide me with guidance and offer a wider thinking to the younger generation that I never had access to whilst at school/college.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"I am booked for further upcoming events and include \u201cUniversity, is this the path?\u201d (options of university, careers and considerations of other industry qualifications), and, of course, CEMEX gets a great mention!!!!\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Spring is nearly here and it\u2019s very welcome after the long winter months. Sean Cassidy and colleagues will soon be getting on with the job of monitoring wildlife as required by the Biodiversity Action Plans.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sean explains: \u201cWe get a lot of help from CEMEX staff, the RSPB, several NGOs (e.g. Butterfly Conservation, Wildlife Trusts) and visitors to our sites. We are very grateful for the help and enthusiasm we\u2019ve received over the last year. I have prepared a summary of 2019 which was another good year. &nbsp;This subject is becoming more important for the business because of changes to UK law requiring Biodiversity Net Gain and also because it links to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2019 Summary:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>69 species of birds on the red or amber lists were spotted in our quarries in 2019. Our Twite project at Dove Hole quarry continues to help prevent this species from going extinct in England.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites are also important habitats for insects especially as we don\u2019t use pesticides. Bumblebees were present at all of our sites with BAPs and some rarer solitary bees were also spotted. Some sites found nearly 70 species of insect. Of the UK butterfly species 70% of them were spotted at CEMEX sites during 2019. &nbsp;The rarest find was a Blind Cave Spider in the lesser Garth Cave at Taffs Well quarry \u2013 this spider is an IUCN listed species.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites are also home to many mammals. With 14 sites housing badgers, 12 have spotted brown hares and two sites are home to our largest mammals \u2013 red deer. &nbsp;Mammal populations in the UK are in decline so it\u2019s important for our BAPs to focus on projects designed to help them such as the Dormouse \u2013 found at only one of our sites in 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Legally protected amphibians and reptiles are also present at many of our sites. The best site for spotting reptiles is West Heath in Sussex as they\u2019ve created specialist hibernacula and spotted Adders, Grass Snakes, Slow Worms and the Common Lizard.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wildflower diversity at some quarries is exceptional. We have three quarries with over 100 species, these are helped by the presence of pollinators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fungi are regularly spotted at our sites as they need undisturbed land to thrive. They play a vital role in the ecosystem by breaking down biomass and putting nutrients back into the soil.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our BAPs help us create many different types of habitats across our sites and stakeholder engagement is also key to our success. For example, in the summer of 2019 a Butterfly Day at one of our \u2018mothballed\u2019 quarries in Fife, Scotland was held. &nbsp;We worked with the local community and the Scottish Butterfly Conservation Society to spot butterflies. &nbsp;They managed to spot 128 species in all, including wildflowers and 12 species of butterfly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our sites continue to provide a haven for British wildlife and create important spaces in which we can encourage and support some of the rarest plants and animals.<\/p>"

But we acknowledge that this is not enough. This is why we have defined a more ambitious target of a 35% reduction of net specific CO2 emissions by 2030. This new goal is aligned with the Science-Based Targets methodology, a requirement climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.<\/p>\n\n<p>To complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX is also establishing a new ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050. In our business, we believe concrete\u2014our end product\u2014has a key role to play in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy, and is an essential component in the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings, and resilient infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cClimate change has been a priority for CEMEX for many years. Our efforts have brought significant progress to date, but we must do more. This is why we have defined a more ambitious strategy to reduce CO2 emissions by 2030 and to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050,\u201d said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>To fulfill this strategy, we have a detailed CO2 roadmap to accelerate the roll-out of proven technologies in all of our facilities, including investing in energy efficiency, using alternative fuels, expanding the use of renewable energy, and increasing the substitution of clinker with alternative cementitious materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, our new net-zero CO2 concrete aspiration for 2050 sets us on a path of open innovation that requires strategic partnerships and cross-industry collaboration in the development of breakthrough technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage; novel clinkers with low heat consumption, alternative decarbonated raw materials, carbonation of concrete waste for use as recycled aggregates, and the promotion of circular economy models that transform waste into fuel. CEMEX currently consumes as either alternative fuel or alternative raw material 32 times more waste from other industries than the waste it generates and sends to landfill.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information on the company\u2019s new Climate Action strategy, please visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.com/en/sustainability/climate-action\">https://www.cemex.com/en/sustainability/climate-action<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>RAF Coningsby is one of the UK\u2019s Quick Reaction Alert Stations which protect UK airspace. It is the home of two frontline, combat-ready squadrons and the main base for the RAF\u2019s Typhoon fighter aircraft. CEMEX\u2019s Lincoln coating plant provided the asphalt over five months as a key part of the prestigious runway resurfacing project.&nbsp;<br />\nA specific challenge of this project was the requirement for the site to always remain fully operational, so the Typhoons could be scrambled in case of an emergency. As a result, contractor Colas resurfaced a short section of the runway each night. CEMEX provided a Porous Friction Course to meet the Ministry of Defence\u2019s complex asphalt specifications, supplying up to 450 tonnes per shift.&nbsp;<br />\nJames Playford, Area Manager for Asphalt, commented: \u201cMeeting the requirements of this project required exceptional teamwork, and I am very proud of my colleagues and what we have achieved. Initially, we were only expecting to supply the surface course material, however once the job had started the binder course layers also had to be replaced, which greatly increased the amount of product needed.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cTherefore, coordination between several different areas of the business was vital. Our aggregates team at Roan Edge Quarry was the only site that could supply us with the required premium quality hardstone and so had to work under considerable pressure; the technical team ensured we met the product specification; the sales team engaged with Colas; while the operational team fulfilled every single order to time, keeping the plant running day and night throughout the project.<br />\n\u201cWe wanted Colas to be reassured from the start of this high-profile scheme that we were the right supplier for this project, with the resources to create the perfect product. We carried out extensive mix testing and laying trials, as well providing a full operational capability tour of the asphalt plant. This comprehensive and dedicated approach paid off and we are pleased the project has been such a success.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX worked for UK infrastructure contractor Colas on the project. Procurement Manager Steve Bryant commented: \u201cWe were very impressed by CEMEX\u2019s collaborative approach, which ensured they could meet the intricate specificities of the project in the constrained timeframe. The finished runaway is a quality surface that will play a key part in this site\u2019s defence work. All of the CEMEX employees involved should be very proud.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>Roger Taylor, DSM Ops Manager commented, \u201cTo gain access to the site you have to get through 6 locked gates and we sometimes have drivers sleep in their cabs overnight. Kevin Hyams, Dry Silo Engineer, recognized the hazard of drivers being locked in and raised a NMHA card.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Roger had another concern that a post code for the Quarry did not exist and was worried that the Fire Brigade would not know where to go in a real emergency.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, he invited Essex Fire and Rescue to the plant so that they could update their response file to the site. The file automatically gets displayed in the cab of the Fire engines in an emergency and this will notify the Fire Fighters of any instructions on how to enter the site and any harmful or flammable products on site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Paul Adams Fire Chief for Braintree fire station was very impressed with our emergency readiness and asked if they could carry out a Confined Rescue drill, one to test their response and two to test our procedures. The idea was that only Paul knew the layout of the plant and what we were intending to do, the rest of the team just knew it was a training drill but didn\u2019t know what to expect including getting through 6 locked gates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lee Liggan, Plant Manager for Braintree DSM prepared the silo before the Fire Brigade got there and lowered a dummy down under controlled circumstances. Lee was also the first contact when the Fire Brigade got on site, it is crucial the first contact gives clear and precise information on what has happened to minimise any reaction times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though Roger had organised the rescue with the Brigade, he couldn\u2019t believe how many people and machines needed to turn out to rescue one person. Roger commented \u201cWe had two fire engines, a truck loaded with specialist rescue equipment, a ALP (Articulated Lifting Platform), a hazardous material response truck and numerous other vehicles. It was very impressive to see how everyone knew their job, their own procedures were obviously very well drilled, no one was allowed in/out of the building without being checked in/out, instructions were clearly communicated, their equipment was the best you can get.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing that surprised Roger was how long it took to get set up and ensure all controls were in place before a rescue person was allowed to enter the Confined Space and attend to the injured party, in a real situation this would feel like an eternity. But this is the same of our \u201cStop and Think\u201d ensuring all hazards have been identified and controls put in place before continuing. Roger concludes by saying that \u201cthere is no point attempting to save someone if the rescuer is going to get hurt.\u201d<\/p>"

Salford has benefited from having the railway line near, as these can act as wildlife corridors in heavily built up areas.&nbsp;<br />\nIf you offer the birds some food using a seed feeder or bird table keep this within easy reach for them, with just a hop from a bush or tree as&nbsp;the birds then feel safer and less vulnerable to predators and are more likely to use your feeder. Goldfinches are one of the species that are doing well and coping with changes in the environment and climate. They are generalists and well adapted to take advantage of bird feeders.&nbsp;<br />\nIf you\u2019d never seen the bird before you\u2019d wonder why&nbsp;this bird is called a Goldfinch, with its distinctive red and black face, but it opens up a beautiful fringed, fan of golden feathers when you see one fly away.<\/p>\n\n<p>RSPB\u2019s BGBW is all about monitoring using your observations in citizen science to work out what is happening nationally to bird numbers so we can spot when a species or suite of birds is in trouble.&nbsp; If you would like to find out more, visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch/results/\">https://www.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch/results/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>In these strange times, whilst we all need to stay home and stay safe, take time to watch the birds in your garden, put up a feeder and find the enjoy in bringing wildlife closer to you.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX have been partners with the RSPB for over 10 years, working together to help wildlife at their sites is just one aspect of the partnership.&nbsp;<br />\nImage credit: Tim Melling<\/p>"

Shortly after, the construction chemicals specialists will produce a stock for six months. Moreover, CEMEX personnel are supporting pharmacies and hospitals in purchasing raw materials. As all CEMEX sites in Europe will soon be equipped with sanitiser, the company plans to play an increasingly important role in supporting local communities by providing much needed disinfectants. Sanitisers will also be made available to customers on a cost base only.<\/p>\n\n<p>Marcelo Catala, CEMEX Europe VP of Urbanization Solutions at CEMEX, emphasizes: \u201cWe have extraordinary talent, creativity and expertise in our Teams; scale to leverage\u2026 and above all the determination to put our teamwork and solutions at the service of our Colleagues and the Communities in which we operate. New products in our offer reflect our engagement to local environmental dynamics and urbanization needs\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Admixtures plants usually produce construction chemicals such as air-entraining agents, water reducers, concrete retarders, accelerators and superplasticizers. Therefore, the production facility in question and its specialist staff are well positioned to ensure safety and quality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The formulations are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for relatively simple, local production. ISOCLEAN WHO 1 is an alcoholic solution containing 70 to 80% ethanol. The reagents are ethanol 96%, hydrogen peroxide 3%, glycerol 98%, and sterile distilled or boiled cold water. The second formulation, ISOCLEAN WHO 2, is based on 70 to 80% propan-2-ol. In this instance, the alcohol component is isopropyl alcohol 99.8% instead of ethanol. In both cases, the potent disinfectant mixture is supplied in 5-litre containers together with a user manual and safety instructions. Hand sanitisers in the form of gel or liquid are particularly effective and work quickly.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX Europe\u2019s cross-divisional Rapid Response Team is working in close coordination with the company\u2019s headquarters in Mexico as well as colleagues on several continents. \u201cWe share our findings so that they can be leveraged by our international colleagues as quickly as possible,\u201d explains Marcelo Catala. \u201cWe hope that our efforts will help keep our employees and our external stakeholders safe.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about CEMEX, please contact Sarah Murphy: <a href=\"mailto:sarah.murphy@cemex.com\">sarah.murphy@cemex.com<\/a>&nbsp;or call 07557 319972<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

The site is being restored to heathland; which is a high priority habitat for the area. &nbsp;Wildlife such as the adder, grass snake and common lizard, as well as rare and red listed birds such as the dartford warbler, nightjar and woodlark all benefit from this kind of habitat. Once restored the site will form part of a wider network of heath and woodland mosaics that includes Cannock Chase.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nOvertime the site has become dominated by bracken and bramble with scrub starting to encroach, without undertaking vital management the heathland would be lost, and these priority species will lose their home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A site visit to Rugeley took place in early March, before physical distancing, with Alex Finn from the CEMEX Restoration Team; Gareth Fenna, Quarry Manager; Jenny Oldroyd, RSPB Partnership Advisor; Jaclyn Lake, Natural England; and Wesley Parnell, RSPB heathland management team, to make an initial overview assessment of the heath\u2019s management needs. It was a really positive visit with all parties keen to work together. The weather was kind and the warm spring sunshine gave some great wildlife sightings too, with Woodlark calling, Goshawk seen and even Adder giving us a hiss, as we accidentally disturbed it, before sliding off and vanishing under the bracken.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX are working in-partnership with the RSPB, and liaising with Natural England, to pull together a plan to manage the adjacent land that is part of the SAC. This plan will be a long-term commitment by CEMEX; the vision is to bring back a more diverse structure to the heath; reduce bracken cover and manage scrub. This is going to be challenging in such an open area. With the first phase being a survey to identify which areas to prioritise management and to identify wildlife that use the site. After which a management plan will be drafted, and the vital management work started.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: Dartford Warbler taken by Tim Melling.<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Keeping happy and healthy both physically and mentally is key to how we bounce back out of this situation, as gradually restrictions are lifted. This is also true of our children - many parents will talk of children having cabin fever - there are well documented connections between spending time outdoors in nature and our feelings of wellbeing.<\/p>\n\n<p>During lockdown lots of people are seeing wildlife in their gardens, many are noticing more about nature locally whilst working from home, either in their gardens or on daily exercise. &nbsp;To encourage this, our partner the RSPB runs a programme called Wild Challenge \u2013 an opportunity for people to connect with the natural world in brave new ways \u2013 to reach out and touch it and meet it head-on, up-close and personal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Three of the leaders from across the UK business took part in the Wild Challenge, and hopefully this will encourage you and your families to participate too! Find out more below\u2026<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve Redwood, Land Development and Permitting Director for Europe, is on lockdown in rural Cambridgeshire with his family \u2013 three boys. Like many others he has been making the most of the weather and helping his children connect with nature on his doorstep for daily lockdown exercise and to fight off cabin fever!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve decided to participate in the RSPB\u2019s Wild Challenge with his youngest son, Harry (eight years old), by combining a birdwatching wildlife walk with sowing wildflowers for bees. They walked around the local farmers\u2019 fields looking for birds, insects and basically anything moving!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Steve says: \u201cOur walk took us around the local field boundaries; we saw hedge sparrows, a pair of Red Kites who nest in the local woodland being chased by three or four crows and on adjacent lakes we could see a pair of nesting swans. My son was particularly interested in the badger sett we saw by the woodland and discussed why we did not see any badgers during the day. On our way home we walked past a pond and saw a grass snake (well I think it was?) swimming across the pond.<\/p>\n\n<p>At home we sowed some wildflower seeds on a patch of open land in our garden. We used some wildflower seeds bound in clay that you throw on the prepared ground (raked over and watered) - called Beebombs which are great for kids and very easy to sow. We discussed the importance of wildflowers for bees and how important bees are for the countryside, biodiversity and their role in the ecosystems. Adding a nectar corner, full of flowers for bees, butterflies, hoverflies is a really rewarding way to add more colour to the garden and help nature.&nbsp;<br />\nWe had a really enjoyable day and have done a little to help wildlife. We had some quality time together outside, and quite an exciting and interesting afternoon!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, CEMEX Managing Director UK Materials Lex Russell, is on lockdown in Edinburgh with his older son and Lex decided to take part in the RSPB\u2019s Wild Challenge, by looking for Signs of Spring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Lex commented: \u201cThe changes to all of our lives that the COVID pandemic has brought have been unprecedented. &nbsp;My personal situation found me in lockdown in Edinburgh sharing a flat with no garden with my eldest son. The challenges of work during the crisis were some of the most extreme that I have ever endured. Very quickly it became apparent that during lockdown I needed to look after both my physical and mental wellbeing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Working with the RSPB I have developed a great passion for engaging with nature in our quarries and sites, so the \u201cfirst signs of spring\u201d initiative seemed like a good opportunity for me, to let nature help me maintain my overall wellbeing. &nbsp;My highlight is the early morning walks along the Water of Leith listening to the dawn chorus and smelling the aroma of the wildflowers. &nbsp;This gave me the inspiration to deal with all of the challenges I had to face in a working day.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>It can be hard to find green space in the heart of a cities, but parks and communal gardens are a place to start, with rivers sides and canal paths being richer in nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nLex:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listened to the dawn chorus.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listened to a bird in full song.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looked for spring - finding the first flowers.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Found the first trees coming into leaf.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Watched for invertebrates- butterflies and pollinators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, Andy Spencer, VP Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for the EMEAA Region, took part in a Wild Challenge is his back garden \u2013 going on a bug safari!<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy is spending lockdown at home with his family in Leicestershire and taking time out in his garden has given him the opportunity to check in on the two bee and bug hotels he installed a few years ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy says: \u201cThe bee and bug hotels have been a very easy way to encourage more wildlife into our garden \u2013 it was literally just a case of hanging them up on the fence! I installed a couple of them about three years ago, both on a south facing fence at the bottom of the garden, near to a tree and some Laurel bushes.<\/p>\n\n<p>We had to be patient at first but in the second year we started to notice the holes being filled and then in springtime a frenzy of activity during the day. They are now used a lot by solitary bees. One of the bee hotels has different spaces for insects and we have seen lacewings and other insects around it.<br />\nI definitely think we have seen more bees in the garden as a result. Although it is a small garden, we have a few miniature fruit trees and we seem to be getting better pollination and more fruit over the past couple of years. We have also noticed last year and this year several ground nesting bee nests \u2013 and the bees are not aggressive at all so no fear for the kids!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>As you can see from these three examples, wherever we are spending lockdown there are still plenty of opportunities to get out and experience nature. &nbsp;If you\u2019d like to take part in your own Wild Challenge, click through the link below:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-families/family-wild-challenge/\">https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-families/family-wild-challenge/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Products that can reduce the use of additional materials and equipment and working in confined spaces, while allowing effective use of labour and maintaining physical distance guidelines are likely to be of increased demand as construction resumes.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Options from CEMEX to support these requirements include high performance concrete solutions, mortars and its digital platform CEMEX Go.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">For example, Evolution™, CEMEX\u2019s self-compacting concrete range, which can spread into place, fill formwork, and encapsulate even the most congested reinforcement by means of its own weight, with little or no vibration. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">This self-compacting concrete is ideal for casting heavily reinforced sections or can be placed where there can be no access to vibrators for compaction and in complex shapes of formwork which may otherwise be impossible to cast, giving a far superior surface to conventional concrete.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">As self-compacting concrete can flow from a single point* it is self-levelling, self-compacting and eliminates the need to hire expensive vibration equipment or use additional labour. This offers both health &amp; safety and cost benefits. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Additionally, the Advanced fibre reinforced concretes, a range of fibre reinforced ready-mix concretes, containing a blend of polypropylene micro fibres and engineered macro fibre or steel fibre solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">There are many features of fibre reinforced concrete, however the main one is the reduction or elimination of crack control steel mesh. This provides a number of benefits, including a reduction in material delivered, stored and handled on site and the minimisation of labour required for cutting and placing steel reinforcement. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Rapid hardening concrete, such as CEMEX\u2019s Promptis, can also help save valuable time during construction. Promptis has similar characteristics to conventional concrete but it can reach accelerated early strength after just six hours while still maintaining initial flow properties and consistence for up to 120 minutes. Formwork can be stripped after only six hours (subject to mix design and guidance). Benefits of this type of product include increased productivity, cost savings and removal of on-site delays.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Meanwhile, CEMEX\u2019s factory produced mortars offer clean, efficient production with reduced wastage and increased productivity on site. CEMEX can provide dry mortar in a silo, ready-to-use wet mortar and dry bagged mortar, meaning there is a solution available whatever the size of the site or requirements of the job. The dry silo systems also reduce manual handling and the risk of injury in production, for improved health and safety. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Finally, the CEMEX Go digital platform allows customers to easily order online, whatever their location. This means they can manage their account quickly and efficiently, including tracking deliveries, receiving digital invoices, placing and amending orders, without having to be in the office. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">Richard Kershaw, Technical Manager for CEMEX Materials UK, commented: \u201cWith safe working on site paramount and physical distancing guidelines still in effect, products that minimise labour, contribute to physical distance and reduce additional materials or equipment on site whilst simultaneously maximising productivity are now essential.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">\u201cWe therefore wanted to identify and highlight which of our products and services would be of most use to our customers in this regard. Using a self-levelling concrete, or our digital ordering platform for instance, can ease the challenge of meeting public health guidelines while continuing operations, ensuring a safe yet productive site. As a business, CEMEX continues to provide a full service as it has done throughout the pandemic and we are ready to meet our customers\u2019 needs and support their projects, whatever the requirements.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height:107%\">CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about the products and services CEMEX offers to help customers meet site working requirements, visit <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/physical-distancing-on-construction-sites\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/physical-distancing-on-construction-sites<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<br />\n* &nbsp;On large pours more than one point may be required<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>VIAPATH can be laid between 25mm and 70mm thick, eliminating the need for multi-layer surfacing which can be costly \u2013 both in terms of the materials and labour required. It also presents significant time savings, which helps to limit the disruption to pedestrians and other road users and achieve a faster rate of job completion. In addition, multi-layer construction can often lead to damage in underlying layers resulting in further delays and spiralling costs.<br />\nFor those looking to incorporate more eco-friendly products into their construction projects, VIAPATH offers real sustainability benefits. It achieves a carbon footprint reduction for a project by requiring less fuel use during the paving operation, less tack coat/bond coat and lower on-site wastage.&nbsp;<br />\nA further benefit of this single layer solution is that it addresses a common cause of potholes caused by traditional pavement construction. Typically, a horizontal joint would be required between the binder course and surface course layers which presents an inherent risk to the ingress of water. With VIAPATH this joint is eliminated, thus improving the overall structural durability of the pavement.<br />\nMartin Ashfield, Technical Manager for Asphalt &amp; Paving, CEMEX Europe, commented: \u201cAs more and more of us adapt to new ways of sustainable travelling that also eases pressure on public transport, the development of cycle and footpaths is critical.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cFortunately, VIAPATH is a premium-quality asphalt solution that has been specifically designed to replace surface, regulating or binder courses in a single pass. This will allow our customers to quickly meet government demands for fast pop-up solutions, while also being cost-effective and minimising disruption to pedestrians, cyclists and other road users.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\nFor more information about VIAPATH, visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/viapath-asphalt-for-cycle-lanes-footpaths\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/viapath-asphalt-for-cycle-lanes-footpaths<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<br />\n* &nbsp;For pavements that will be trafficked by heavy vehicles, multiple layers may be required.<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

The 2020 Competition remains open until July 26, 2020.&nbsp;<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arqlite gets support from large investors, also working on circular economy issues, such as Kamay Ventures, a venture capital fund made up of Arcor SAIC and Coca-Cola Argentina, and Chriss Graff, founder of the NYC Curb-To-Market Challenge, among others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>MONTERREY, MEXICO. JUNE 30, 2020 \u2013 CEMEX Ventures, CEMEX's Corporate Venture Capital and open innovation unit, today announced its investment in Arqlite SPC, a US company based in California. Arqlite SPC processes unrecyclable plastic waste into artificial gravel that avoids the use of natural quarry aggregates and boulders in the production of light concrete with a low CO2 footprint and installs drainage beds for construction and landscaping. CEMEX Ventures\u2019 new alliance with Arqlite SPC offers an innovative solution around the construction industry\u2019s circular economy: it gives a second life to plastic and reduces the carbon footprint and operating costs of handling and producing construction materials such as aggregates and concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arqlite SPC began its research and development process in Argentina in 2016 and has developed an innovative technology that allows most of the plastic waste to be recycled instead of disposal at a landfill or polluting the environment. The light aggregates it produces represent a great advance in sustainable construction, multiplying thermal and acoustic insulation by 10 times compared to mineral aggregates and offering better construction quality and greater energy conservation. The aggregate is three times lighter than stone, making it excellent for low CO2 concrete that is also intended to reduce required structural supports and to significantly lower transportation costs. The low thermal conductivity of plastic reduces its reaction to extreme temperature variations and, therefore, the possibility of fracturing or altering the concrete mix.<\/p>\n\n<p>One million plastic bottles are purchased every minute and 500 billion plastic bags are used annually. In addition, eight million tons end up in oceans every year, threatening marine life. For this reason, CEMEX Ventures and Arqlite SPC offer a low-cost technological solution, capable of processing the vast majority of plastic waste as raw material. Due mainly to the lack of environmental awareness and existing technological limitations, it is estimated that only 7% of the 300 million tons of plastic waste generated is finally recycled.<\/p>\n\n<p>This investment by CEMEX Ventures is part of CEMEX's ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete to all of its customers globally by 2050, as this solution uses practically all types of plastics as raw material, preventing them from ending up in landfills or unsustainable destinations.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlastic waste processing is a global problem with no large-scale solution so far. We believe that, due to the large volume of material used by the construction industry, we can recycle much of this plastic waste, making us a solution to this problem, while generating construction materials with better functionality and a lower carbon footprint. That is why this investment has a double mission: to help mitigate the great problem of plastic waste and, simultaneously, to produce construction materials with a low CO2 footprint,\" said Cristina Aparicio, Head of CEMEX Ventures investment in Arqlite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arqlite SPC installs version 2.0 of its technology in its new factory in Santa Ana, California, based on developments in Argentina. This new production plant has machinery from different European countries, which, added to the technology designed by the company itself locally, will reach a capacity of 18 thousand tons per year. Its location is strategic for CEMEX, since it is within the radius of several of its concrete and aggregate operations in the California area. In addition, Arqlite already has agreements to recycle plastics from large generators throughout the Los Angeles region and works with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to continue innovating in the construction industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Ventures has joined as investor to Kamay Ventures, venture capital fund of Grupo Arcor SAIC and Coca Cola Argentina, and Chris Graff, founder of NYC Curb-To-Market Challenge, and successful businessman in the manufacturing industry, among others. The good reception to this innovative solution focused on the circular economy has generated interest from numerous actors in different industries, making it easy to scale and implement this solution across various geographies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sebastián Sajoux, CEO and founder of Arqlite SPC, said, \u201cOur technology can become a key player in a large market industry. We have developed a large-scale solution to a large-scale problem.\" Arqlite, which was also the winner of CEMEX Ventures Global Construction Startup Competition 2019, invites entrepreneurs to participate in the 2020 edition of the Competition, which remains open until July 26, 2020. \u201cFor Arqlite SPC, being part of the Global Construction Startup Competition 2019 was very important because working together and being validated by a company like CEMEX Ventures opens new doors for us and helps our brand, which is still small, to reach other large companies that are open to receiving us and hearing about our proposal.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2017, CEMEX Ventures focuses on helping to solve the main challenges and capitalize on the opportunity areas in the construction ecosystem through sustainable solutions. CEMEX Ventures has created an open and collaborative platform to lead the revolution of the construction industry by engaging startups, entrepreneurs, universities, and other relevant actors to tackle the industry's toughest challenges and shape tomorrow's value ecosystem.<br />\nFor more information about CEMEX Ventures, please visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemexventures.com/\">https://www.cemexventures.com/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

CEMEX is involved in this working group focused on the transition to concrete as well as applications to prefabricated parts and structures, and in understanding the accelerated carbonation mechanism for recycled concrete aggregates.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FastCarb Project started in 2016 with a multidisciplinary group of partners, such as public organizations, private research centers, contractors, engineering companies, laboratories, and different industries, including CEMEX. The project works to design and implement an accelerated carbonation process at pre-industrial scale to store CO2 in the aggregates of recycled concrete, and to characterize the environmental and economic viability of the process industrial recycling envisaged.<\/p>\n\n<p>After completing the first phase of the experimental approach at the laboratory level with promising preliminary results, the project is now entering the second phase seeking to tackle the industrial approach. In this industrial approach phase, CEMEX was recently assigned to evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of the carbonated recycled concrete aggregates when used in ready-mix concrete in the laboratory facilities at the National Technical Center CEMEX France.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis initiative is a relevant component of our ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete globally to all of our customers by 2050,\u201d said Vicente Saiso, CEMEX\u2019s Director of Sustainability. \u201cFastCarb aims to allow us to develop the circular economy of concrete by improving the quality of recycled concrete aggregates.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>All three products in the system are high performance and offer rapid strength, including; STREETPAVE PaveBase bedding mortar; PaveGrip priming slurry; and PaveFill flowing joining mortar. These products can be used together for pavements constructed with clay, natural stone or concrete pavers.<br />\nSTREETPAVE PaveBase bedding mortar is made from cement and graded aggregates, and is available in a silo, bulk and 25kg bags. Once applied it is highly durable, suitable for walking on in 12 hours and driving on in 24 hours, and can be laid from 10-75mm in one pass. It is perfect for paved areas of mixed foot and vehicular traffic alongside general private and public hardscape areas.<br />\nMeanwhile, STREETPAVE PaveGrip priming slurry uses specially selected aggregates to create the essential bond between the bedding and the paving element. Delivered in bulk or 25kg bag, it is applied with a brush at 1-2mm thick and is suitable for high-trafficked pavement.<br />\nSTREETPAVE PaveFill flowing joining mortar is the final step in this premium quality system. It is fast-setting and frost resistant with a 40MPa compressive strength and low shrinkage. Simple to mix and apply, PaveFill can be applied in joint widths of 5-50mm and up to 200mm deep in a single pass.<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, commented: \u201cCEMEX is a UK leader in specialist mortar systems for hard landscaping and our new STREETPAVE system is a further demonstration of our expertise; allowing our customers to construct resilient pavements that meet and exceed the strict demands of BS 7533.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe STREETPAVE system has been designed so it can work as a three-stage process with each product tested individually and collectively. The long-term value of using such high-quality products is clear; BS 7533 compliant systems are more robust and provide better overall value than non-compliant systems as they require less maintenance and last longer, in some cases exceeding 40 years. We know our customers want reliable, effective products and we are proud to offer the STREETPAVE system to help meet their paving requirements.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\nFor further information about the STREETPAVE system, please visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/mortar-mix-for-paving-streetpave\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/mortar-mix-for-paving-streetpave<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.
