They make new friends, meet others from different cultures, visit theatres and museums and can be signposted to help with health, legal and career issues.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFortune helps them become more resilient, happier and more valuable members of their new country.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nJohn Martin, Artistic Director, Pan Intercultural Arts, said: \u201cWe are delighted that we have established a partnership with CEMEX so that Fortune can help these young people develop in their growth and new journey.

        "Body": "<p>In addition, the remaining carbon emissions from using the concrete are offset to provide a CarbonNeutral® product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. The product, used for the first time in London, has been supplied to HS2\u2019s enabling works contractor, Costain Skanska joint venture, and Lydon Contracting Ltd by global building materials manufacturer CEMEX, from their plant based in Wembley.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>After engineering carbon reductions into the concrete mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the concrete carbon neutral from manufacture to use.<\/p>\n\n<p>To achieve carbon neutrality, carbon is offset by the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. CEMEX facilitates this by investing in projects which physically remove CO2 where possible from the atmosphere, such as planting more trees or protecting against deforestation through an independently audited and verified project. This is done in accordance with international standards for carbon neutrality.&nbsp;<br />\nThe first use of the Vertua Classic Zero concrete in the capital recently took place at a HS2 site in North West London, ready to prepare the ground for an electricity substation which will power the tunnel boring machines excavating HS2\u2019s London tunnels. A further delivery of Vertua is planned at the same site by the end of October. By using this low carbon concrete, a total of 12 tonnes of carbon should be saved once deliveries are complete, with an additional 17 tonnes of residual CO2 offset. &nbsp;<br />\nDiscussions are continuing as to how this technology can be adopted on further sites across the HS2 route.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>HS2 aims to build the most sustainable highspeed railway in the world and is driving innovation in design, construction and operation to minimise its entire carbon footprint. In order to become the UK\u2019s most environmentally responsible infrastructure project, HS2 has set a carbon reduction target of 50% target for its contractors on construction baselines for Phase One civil assets (such as tunnels, viaducts and cuttings), stations and railway systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Peter Miller, Environment Director, HS2 Ltd said:<br />\n\u201cWe know that climate change is the greatest long-term threat to Britain\u2019s security and prosperity. The Government has set a target for net-zero emissions by 2050 and HS2 is playing its part in meeting that challenge.<br />\n\u201cUsing innovative techniques and products in the construction of the new high speed railway, we can not only build HS2 more sustainably, but we can lead by example, showing how the construction sector can help deliver Britain\u2019s cleaner greener future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Dan Hunt, Programme Director at Costain Skanska joint venture said:<br />\n\u201cWorking closely with our supply chain, CSjv has identified many ways to maximise our environmental credentials, leading to more than 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) saved to date. We have focused on identifying innovations and efficiencies throughout our whole programme, from our power supplies and fuel sources through to working methodology by reducing and recycling materials.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe have worked hard to reduce the amount of concrete needed across the programme and by working with CEMEX, we have further reduced our carbon footprint of our works.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Richard Kershaw, Technical Manager for Materials at CEMEX UK, said:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are proud to have supplied this HS2 site with our Vertua concrete, the first time this low-carbon product has been used in our country\u2019s capital. We know that minimising the carbon footprint for the HS2 project is of real importance, and our Vertua concrete offers an easy way to make a more sustainable choice for such an important product. We look forward to exploring the other opportunities for Vertua to be used as part of HS2 .\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>When operational HS2 will offer people a cleaner, greener way to travel with lower carbon emissions per passenger kilometre, than cars and domestic air travel. HS2 trains will be highly energy efficient and powered by electricity from an increasingly decarbonised electricity grid. In the future, with electricity generation fully decarbonised, travelling on HS2 will be a zero-carbon activity. In addition HS2 will free up extra space on the existing rail network. It will take cars and lorries off the road and reduce the need for domestic air travel. This will reduce transport carbon emissions and improve air quality.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nENDS<br />\nNotes to Editors&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>The ambitious target of making carbon capture technology accessible and more efficient would be an unprecedented achievement for the cement sector, opening a door of opportunities for further developments.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the responsibility of taking action to fight climate change and shift towards a carbon-neutral economy, CEMEX joins forces with Carbon Clean to make possible the development of a technology that allows for the economically viable capture of CO2 emissions in the cement industry at industrial scale.<\/p>\n\n<p>As part of the agreement, both companies will further develop and adapt Carbon Clean\u2019s third generation modularized carbon capture technology for the cement industry. Carbon Clean uses an integrated modular system that works using rotating packed beds (RPBs) to intensify the carbon capture process. This technology could provide a significant reduction in both capital cost and equipment size, when compared to traditional capture technologies, enabling the wider-scale commercial deployment of carbon capture systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>The technology will be tested for the first time in the cement industry at a CEMEX facility by deploying an industrial-scale pilot during the first quarter of 2021. CEMEX and Carbon Clean will jointly work toward making the solution even more efficient before the construction of what would be the most cost-effective commercial installation for carbon capture in the cement industry to date. With the capacity to capture up to 100,000 tons of CO2 per year at a cost lower than U.S.$30/ton of CO2 captured; this is a very relevant step in developing the technology required for adoption by the entire cement sector at a worldwide scale.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cAccomplishing CO2 capture at an industrial scale and affordable cost is one of the biggest challenges that CEMEX is facing in its road to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete products globally by 2050. Partnering with Carbon Clean seemed like a perfect fit for us. We believe in their technology and know that working together, we can make possible a more cost-effective carbon capture solution below the U.S.$30/ton threshold,\u201d said Gonzalo Galindo, Head of CEMEX Ventures.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cCarbon Clean\u2019s vision of working with players from various industries is something we value in CEMEX Ventures. Due to the impact of CO2 emissions on global warming and the importance of implementing new solutions to reduce the environmental impact, we look forward to joining efforts with other companies that are also working towards achieving carbon neutrality.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Aniruddha Sharma, CEO of Carbon Clean, said: \u201cWe are delighted to be partnering with CEMEX to deliver on our shared goal of decarbonizing the cement sector through the utilization of CCUS. We are confident that this partnership and the operating experience of CEMEX will help us bring down the cost of carbon capture to just U.S.$30/ton of CO2 captured by 2021, which will help accelerate take-up of the technology across the cement industry and beyond.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX.<br />\nCustomers in several European countries are using Vertua® in flagship infrastructure projects and many climate-friendly building projects, reducing their construction CO2 footprint significantly.<br />\nVertua® net-zero carbon concrete is possible due to an innovative geopolymer binder solution created by CEMEX\u2019s Research and Development Center in Switzerland. This solution has a reduced carbon footprint of up to 70% without sacrificing performance. The compensation of the remaining CO2 is achieved by participating in reforestation projects, among other initiatives.<br />\nEarly this year, CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy, defining a global target of a 35% reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products by 2030. Additionally, it is the industry's first company to target a CO2 reduction in its European operations of at least 55% by 2030. To complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX also established an ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 in all its concretes globally by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

Through the removal of water, this admixture technology allows for the treated material to be transported and disposed of safely.<br />\nAdditionally, these solutions can also reduce a project\u2019s carbon footprint; they provide an alternative solution to quicklime, and are more cost-effective when compared to a pure cement solution due to the lower dosages required. A broad range of formulations are available, including a cement-free option.&nbsp;<br />\nThe ISOFINES 5000 Series also has the added feature of quickly recycling liquified and difficult to handle mud \u2013 a solid material is obtained facilitating landfilling, and thereby reducing pollution. It can be delivered in bulk recycled plastic bags or silos which means there is no waste material on jobsites and a great volume is transported.&nbsp;<br />\nVirginia Flek, National Technical Sales Executive for CEMEX Admixtures, commented: \u201cThe ISOFINES 5000 Series is an excellent addition to our high-quality admixtures range; presenting safe and easy drying solutions which also offer considerable sustainability benefits.<br />\n\u201cThis series is already available in France and has been used on extensions to the Metro lines in Paris with great success.

It is now a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. Such is the popularity of the nature reserve, an area of restored former sand and gravel quarries alongside the River Trent south of Nottingham, that the charity reached its ambitious £1million target in a matter of weeks \u2013 enabling negotiations over the sale of the site to begin.<br />\nNow, with contracts signed and exchanged, Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust is planning for the long-term future of the site, which provides a safe haven for over 1,000 species including otters and bitterns and welcomes an estimated half a million visitors each year.<br />\nSince being opened by Sir David Attenborough in 1966 Attenborough Nature Reserve, situated on the edge of Nottingham, has become one of the best loved nature reserves in the UK. The Trust has worked closely with CEMEX over this period to create a reserve which is an excellent example of how industry can work with conservation bodies to create a site high in biodiversity which is of national importance.<br />\nStephen Redwood, Land Development and Permitting Director for CEMEX Europe said \u201cAfter more than half a century of partnership, we are enormously pleased to see the transfer of this amazing and award-winning site to the Trust being completed. To see Attenborough evolve into such an important nature reserve in such close proximity to major population centres has been most rewarding.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cOur partnership with the Trust - which has included the establishment of the impressive Visitor Centre with support from the company\u2019s own Landfill Communities Fund - has been a major success and we look forward to the Trust taking ownership as the site moves on to the next phase in its development.\u201d<br />\nSpeaking on behalf of the Trust, Chief Executive Paul Wilkinson said: \u201cThe support of Biffa Award and the backing of the public and our supporters has delivered a prize that we have been working with CEMEX to achieve for some time. Attenborough is a cherished site, where so many come to connect with nature. Our aspiration has always been to take the site into our ownership so that we can plan for its long-term future and that future begins today. We would like to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone that has made it possible including Biffa Award, our supporters and CEMEX.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong><br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Display Title": "CEMEX Ventures promotes the redefinition of how houses are designed and built through its investment in Modulous",
        "Body": "<p>CEMEX Ventures, CEMEX's Corporate Venture Capital and open innovation unit, announced today its investment in Modulous, a company with a disruptive offsite construction system, enabled by a digital platform, to allow the high-speed delivery of quality, sustainable and affordable homes. This will transform the construction process as it is currently known, providing the industry with a unique modular construction solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>It has become apparent that modular construction, in its current form, is not efficient. Although it does improve speed and quality of the build process, it needs to make significant improvements to solve the housing crisis. London-based startup Modulous offers a new approach to increase the home production for the UK and support ambitions to meet the housing requirements for the year 2050, when 3 billion people are expected to live in cities, representing 70% of the population.<\/p>\n\n<p>Modulous aims to achieve this through a new construction approach based on a highly engineered kit-of-parts that enables the delivery of high-quality affordable homes at scale and pace. The software platform leverages artificial intelligence, generative design and 5D BIM modelling providing a fully integrated supply chain solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>By digitizing the entire materials supply chain management, Modulous reduces the time and cost overruns common in the construction process. By decentralizing operations this solution can scale rapidly as assembly of the modules is carried out by companies local to the final site. The construction system is easy to assemble, converting the kit of parts into homes in hours instead of months, and further reducing the industry shortage of professionalization.<\/p>\n\n<p>Through their innovative approach, Modulous has already secured a large pipeline of projects across the UK and Europe. It is currently preparing the delivery of a £6.5m residential scheme in London using its smart design and construction system that will achieve completion 12 months ahead of schedule.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"By including Modulous in our portfolio, we offer the industry a unique offsite construction model\" said Mateo Zimermmann, head of CEMEX Ventures investment in Modulous. \"After several years of exploring how this segment is advancing, we placed our trust in this team that perfectly combines engineers, designers, and technological developers. The Modulous innovative approach enables the supply chain to deliver sustainable and high-quality homes, significantly reducing time and costs. Modulous does not require additional capex, which makes it globally scalable. This team is going to revolutionise the residential development industry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Although we are currently focused on the south of England, where we expect to achieve sales of £25 million in the pilot year, we want to offer a global solution to housing needs in Europe,\" said Chris Bone, Co-Founder and Managing Director by Modulous. \"We are delighted to be part of CEMEX's global vision for offsite construction and future collaborations to launch advanced and tailored materials through collaboration in research and development. Having the support and access to customers and suppliers of CEMEX and CEMEX Ventures makes us a more relevant player in the industry where we participate\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Modulous is one of the winners of the 2020 Construction Startup Competition, the annual startup challenge organized by CEMEX Ventures. This startup was also part of the Top 50 ConTech Startups list in 2019.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>About Modulous<br />\nModulous is an award winning, London-based construction technology business that has developed a digital platform and smart kit of parts to enable the delivery of high-quality, sustainable and affordable homes, at scale and pace. The dynamic team of engineers, designers, and software developers has conceived a unique approach that aims to transform the delivery of homes and support ambitions to address the global housing crisis. With its values firmly rooted in creating sustainable places for people to live, at the speed that is needed, Modulous aims to cause a seismic shift within the global construction process.

        "Display Title": "CEMEX Supplies Over 40,000 Tonnes of Primary Sprayed Concrete to London\u2019s \u2018Super Sewer\u2019 Project",
        "Body": "<p>The Tunnel is being built to upgrade London\u2019s sewer system to cope with its growing population. Currently, London relies on a 150-year-old sewer system built for a population less than half its current size. As a result, during periods of heavy rain, the current infrastructure can become overwhelmed.<br />\nThe new 25km tunnel will intercept, store and transfer sewage waste away from the River Thames.&nbsp;<br />\nStarting in Acton, west London, the Thames Tideway Tunnel will travel through the heart of London at depths of between 30 and 60 metres, using gravity to transfer waste eastwards and be processed and dealt with in a modern state of the art facility.<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s primary lining spray concrete is being used for the shafts and launch tunnels in the central part of the project \u2013 a 12.5km stretch of the tunnel moving under central London which is being constructed by a joint venture between Ferrovial Construction and Laing O\u2019Rourke (FLO). The concrete is sprayed from bottom to top in one continuous operation until the shaft wall is complete. An extremely complicated mix is required, consisting of eight separate constituents which when combined give a high strength of +60N/mm2, consistence&nbsp;of 600mm flow and a consistence flow&nbsp;of two hours.&nbsp;<br />\nWhen sprayed it has to adhere to the tunnel or shaft wall / ceiling and gain strength immediately to a high rate of strength gain requirements. The concrete also needs to be highly pumpable, in some cases with a pipeline length of up to 400m.<br />\nCEMEX manufactures the product at its dedicated Spray Concrete plant in Buxton, from where it is transported into central London at rates that peak at around 3,000 tonnes per month. Supply is likely to continue for a few months, although this may need to be extended due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;<br />\nSergio Menendez, President of CEMEX Europe, Middle East, Africa &amp; Asia, said: \u201cThe Tideway project is one of incredible scale which will solve serious capacity issues with London\u2019s sewer system and have considerable benefits for the area\u2019s wildlife and population, while also creating jobs, a rejuvenated river economy and new areas of public space.<br />\n\u201cThis is a serious piece of engineering, and we\u2019re proud to be working with world-class contractors to build this key infrastructure in the most sustainable and cost-effective way possible for one of the world\u2019s greatest cities.&nbsp;<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, added: \u201cOur sprayed concrete forms a key part of the central part of the tunnel and it was vital to get the complicated mix right. Fortunately, we have worked with FLO before and so there was already an understanding of the works required and the performance required from the material to be supplied.\u201d<br />\nBorja Trashorras, Project Manager at FLO\u2019s Albert Embankment site, said: \u201cCEMEX\u2019s primary lining spray concrete provided a good solution at Albert Embankment Foreshore for the construction of both connection tunnels and our 53m drop shaft through some challenging ground conditions. Having sprayed over 5,000 tonnes for this package of works meant we built a strong and reliable line of communication with CEMEX. Logistical planning was essential in the delivery of these works due to our central London location which CEMEX was able to co-ordinate and support with ease.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

The project team comprises leading industrial, technology, and research &amp; development partners.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX had a very active participation in LEILAC 1, working with the partners to develop the novel direct separation of process carbon emissions derived from the clinker/cement manufacture. The highly concentrated CO2 resulting from the technology can then be easily handled via capture and/or storage. Process emissions are roughly 60% of the direct CO2 emissions from cement production. Thus, this technology can contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the whole sector.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is enthusiastic and determined to continue its contributions to the project by bringing expertise, experience, and key resources. For example, simulation experts undertook significant modeling of the CO2 reactor tube to obtain the required capture rate. CEMEX's technical team also tested novel designs for the CO2 reactor tube, given its deep understanding of the cement production process and how the technology can be implemented most effectively.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX decided to participate in LEILAC 2 pursuing and contributing to the technology's development utilizing its gasification process's expertise. It is also leveraging its skills in alternative fuel consumption and computational fluid dynamic simulation design, aiming to succeed in the second stage of the LEILAC project.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Our participation in the LEILAC 2 project is another example of our continued efforts to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete products globally by 2050,\" said Davide Zampini, Head of Global R&amp;D. \"We are determined to have a significant direct involvement in research and development efforts pursuing high impact technologies in carbon capture, use, and storage.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced in 2020 its Climate Action strategy, defining a global target of a 35% reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products by 2030. For its operations in Europe, CEMEX also defined a 55% reduction target, in line with what the European Commission set as a new goal for all its member states.

Additionally, the product\u2019s close surface texture allows for easier cleaning once construction has been completed prior to the final application of surface course.<br />\nVIABASE will also help housing developments to meet the requirements detailed by the government in its construction playbook, which has asked for the industry to move towards sustainable solutions that are high performing, with longevity at the core of decisions when specifying.&nbsp;<br />\nAs well as roads on housing developments, VIABASE is also ideally suited to other areas that are used by heavy duty vehicles, such as farm roads and tracks, large parking areas and industrial construction sites.&nbsp;<br />\nCarl Platt, Director of Asphalt, Paving, and Building Products for Europe, commented: \u201cThe government has been clear that housebuilding levels need to increase, with an aim for 300,000 new houses a year to be delivered. To meet this demand, our construction customers need quality, resilient products that offer solutions to specific issues that arise at these developments.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWith VIABASE, we are pleased to offer a way to ensure the longevity of housing development roads, which standard materials struggle to provide if the surface course is not placed soon after. VIABASE provides a highly durable, low maintenance surface which will meet the challenges presented by heavy duty vehicles and prevent long term problems in the overall pavement construction.\u201d<br />\nVIABASE is produced at all CEMEX asphalt supply plants across the UK and can be delivered or collected.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<br />\nFor more information about VIABASE, visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/viabase-asphalt-concrete-for-housing-estate-roads\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/viabase-asphalt-concrete-for-housing-estate-roads<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

It also revealed the essential nature of our products and services, the value we bring to our customers, and the strength and resiliency of our business,\u201d said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. \u201cSustainability remains to be one of our top priorities, and our Climate Action strategy makes us confident in our ability to achieve our targets and aspirations.\u201d<br />\nAmong the main accomplishments presented in CEMEX Integrated Report 2020 are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>CEMEX developed and implemented more than 50 strict hygiene and safety protocols to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 contagion throughout its worldwide sites and operations.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX reached a low level of employee lost-time injuries (LTIs) for the sector and made progress across most of its countries, with 96% of its operations achieving zero fatalities and LTIs.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX Go was instrumental in allowing customers and employees to work remotely with seamless efficiency and consistently, safely, and reliably deliver products despite the challenging circumstances. 61% of CEMEX total global sales were made digitally through CEMEX Go, with a 90% overall usage rate among recurring customers and high customer satisfaction levels.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy in February 2020, defining a global target of a 35% reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products by 2030. To complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX also established an ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete to all its customers globally by 2050.<\/li>\n\t<li>For its European operations, CEMEX reduced its net CO2 emissions by close to 35% as of December 31st, 2020, and is the first company in the cement industry to define a 55% reduction target, in line with what the European Commission set as a new goal for all its member states.<\/li>\n\t<li>91% of the company´s cement plants co-processed a cumulative 2.7 million tons of waste as alternative fuels, allowing for approximately 1.6 million tons of coal replaced and a 25.3% substitution rate.<\/li>\n\t<li>Clean electricity now covers 29% of CEMEX global consumption in its cement business. In some countries such as the U.K. and Poland, renewable power covers 100% of local cement, concrete, and aggregates business needs.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX globally introduced Vertua®, its low carbon and net-zero CO2 products, a key milestone towards the company´s 2050 CO2 neutrality goal. Vertua® Ultra Zero is the industry\u2019s first concrete product with a Net Zero CO2 footprint, and is already being used in relevant infrastructure and building projects around the world.<\/li>\n\t<li>To respond to market changes in outlook resulting from the pandemic, CEMEX launched Operation Resilience, a medium-term plan to improve operating results, margins and promote growth, sustainability, and financial resilience.<\/li>\n\t<li>The company increased its financial flexibility with the successful amendment of its bank debt under its Facilities Agreement. This transaction underscores CEMEX´s commitment to a carbon-neutral economy by incorporating green metrics and is one of the largest sustainability-linked loans in the world and the largest in emerging markets.<\/li>\n\t<li>CEMEX strengthened the Social Impact strategy that allows it to reinforce initiatives to contribute to communities' well-being.

        "Display Title": "CEMEX Invests for Growth at Selby Depot with Partners Bowker Group and Potter Space",
        "Body": "<p>Together with Bowker, its logistics partner at Selby, and Potter Space (owners of the business park where Selby is located), more than £200,000 has been invested into new rail freight infrastructure and facilities, ensuring the ongoing reliability of the service from this site and enabling the team to increase the number of trains that can run a week.<br />\nConsiderable improvements have been made to the track that travels off the main line and into the Selby depot. Following the investment, around 70 per cent of the track has been completely replaced, with other upgrades such as concrete sleepers made to improve the condition of the track further, and the installation of new loading bays.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, Bowker have made significant investment in its stone discharge facilities at Selby; upgrading safety features to go beyond legislative requirements as well as making significant improvements to equipment and enhancing critical components increasing reliability.&nbsp;<br />\nNeil Bowker, Bowker\u2019s Commercial Director, said: \u201cThe features, including new guards and fencing, are focussed on operator safety; and in general, the improvements will deliver reductions in down time during critical discharge periods. The significant investment demonstrates the commitment Bowker have made to the CEMEX partnership.\u201d<br />\nAs a result of the developments made at the Selby site, the team have been able to increase the number of services run from this depot to three a week. This means an extra 90,000 tonnes of material can be moved by train, taking trucks off the road and maximising the use of rail as a sustainable mode of transport. All this helps support CEMEX\u2019s climate objectives and minimises its impact on the environment.<br />\nDave Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK and France, commented: \u201cWe continue to invest heavily into our rail operations across the country, as this allows us to grow volumes and increase the services we offer. The works at Selby were the latest part of our development programme and it was fantastic to partner with Bowker and Potter Space on the many improvements that have been made \u2013 improvements that will enable us to better and more safely support our customers.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cEnhancing the sustainability of our business is a key priority and the use of rail forms an important part of this \u2013 as every rail freight service removes trucks from the road and achieves additional carbon savings. These investments help us to support CEMEX\u2019s climate initiatives and be a more responsible company.\u201d<br />\nJason Rockett, managing director of Potter Space, added, \u201cPotter Space has a proven track record of working together with customers, so we were pleased to work in partnership with both CEMEX and Bowker at our Potter Space Selby business park. All three parties recognise the value and benefit of rail transportation, so we were delighted to jointly invest in the new rail infrastructure to help meet the needs of CEMEX and support its long-term business plans.\u201d<br />\nThese improvements come as part of a wider investment into Selby, with £0.5million planned for three new bitumen tanks and a reprocessed asphalt system. These will help to achieve further operating efficiencies and minimise waste while improving safety and customer service.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About Bowker Group<br />\nThe Company is a major UK and International logistics provider operating in excess of 160 vehicles and 300 trailers as well as providing over one million square feet of warehousing at their 7 UK Distribution Centres.

        "Summary": "Global building materials solutions supplier CEMEX is proud to present VIALOW, a new addition to the VERTUA family of low carbon and sustainable building solutions. VIALOW is a reduced carbon asphalt which comes with the option to offset residual CO2 to make it a CarbonNeutral® product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.",

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy in February 2020, and in its European operations reduced its CO2 emissions by close to 35% as of December 31st, 2020, ten years ahead of the target date. CEMEX also declared a 55% CO2 reduction target for its European Operations, aligning with the European Commission goal for all member states.<br />\nVIALOW is a new range of low temperature, low carbon asphalts from CEMEX, which uses a specially formulated bitumen additive to enable manufacture at up to 40°C lower than standard asphalt mixes with no compromise in performance, with the added benefit of achieving up to 20% reduction in embodied carbon emissions.&nbsp;<br />\nThe range includes the VIALOW Zero option, which is a CarbonNeutral product, and complements the CEMEX VERTUA range of low carbon building solutions, further enhancing CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action strategy \u2013 committed to Net Zero CO2. As technology and the industry shifts toward low carbon asphalt, the best interim way to sequester the rest of the CO2 footprint, to make it a carbon neutral product, is through carbon offsetting. To do this we are working with Natural Capital Partners, an award-winning expert on carbon neutrality and climate finance, that is harnessing the power of business to create a more sustainable world.<\/p>\n\n<p>VIALOW offers customers a host of other benefits alongside its sustainability credentials. The lower temperature of the manufacturing process can also help to improve the long-term performance and durability of the asphalt, as high temperature in conventional mixes leads to more oxidative hardening of bitumen than is seen in lower temperature variants.<br />\nReduced temperature asphalt also offers safety and environmental benefits which include a reduced risk of burns and lower odours, providing a safer and more pleasant working environment for both workers and neighbours to the construction site. The reduced mixing and paving temperatures of low temperature asphalt can reduce fume generation by around 50% for approximately each 10°C reduction in temperature.<br />\nFurthermore, by virtue of being a low temperature asphalt, VIALOW allows the re-opening of a jobsite more quickly after completion of road works, as the asphalt reaches appropriate trafficking temperatures faster than conventional hot mix asphalt. Alongside minimising disruption and enabling construction programmes to remain on time, this offers further benefits to the environment, as statistics show that stationary traffic caused by road closures creates four times as many pollutants when compared to moving vehicles.<br />\nThe launch of this range follows a report from the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Highways which identified warm mix asphalts (WMA) as an underutilised opportunity to reduce the CO2 emissions associated with asphalt production for road infrastructure. At the time of publishing, the report found that WMAs represent less than 4% of UK asphalt production, yet if all asphalt production in Great Britain had been switched to WMA, it would have saved at least 61,000 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 the equivalent of cutting almost 300 million miles of car journeys.<br />\nCarl Platt, Director of Asphalt, Paving, and Building Products for Europe, commented: \u201cAsphalt is an essential part of our country\u2019s infrastructure; roads provide access to employment, social, health and education services, provide access to more areas and stimulate economic and social development. However, we recognise that future construction needs to be balanced with the effect it is having on the environment.\u201d<br />\n\u201cCEMEX is totally committed to improving the sustainability of its operations and supporting its customers to do the same. With the launch of VIALOW, CEMEX aims to make it simple for customers to choose more sustainable and environmentally-friendly asphalts that have a lower embodied carbon, offset residual emissions and help drive vital change.<br />\n\u201cMoreover, this industry-leading range of low temperature asphalt is designed to produce faster construction times, minimise disruption and reduce road maintenance costs alongside the added benefit of a carbon footprint reduction.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX Urbanisation Solutions is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on our Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.&nbsp;<br />\nVIALOW is available all year round in all Asphalt Concrete Base, Binder and Surface courses as well as Hot Rolled Asphalt (only where pre coated chippings are not required), Stone Mastic Asphalt and the full Proprietary range.<br />\nAfter engineering carbon reductions into the asphalt mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction, transportation and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the asphalt CarbonNeutral from cradle-to-customer.<br />\nCarbon offsetting is the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX will facilitate this by financing projects which physically remove CO2 from the atmosphere, such as planting trees. A CarbonNeutral certificate is then issued to the client.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX calculates the embodied carbon (as CO2e) in the VIALOW range using a Carbon Footprint Calculator in accordance with relevant standards and guidance.&nbsp;<br />\nFor more information about VIALOW visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/vialow-low-temperature-asphalt-for-faster-construction\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/vialow-low-temperature-asphalt-for-faster-construction<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\u2013 ends \u2013&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

This site has a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) in place, and despite the impact of the Coronavirus the team have made good progress on this over the last year.<br />\nThe Denge team have a great relationship with the adjacent RSPB nature reserve at Dungeness. Together they have removed scrub from the islands in the quarry\u2019s saline lagoon (five Islands and several peninsulas in this lagoon have been created as part of the restoration). Scrub, if left, would turn into woodland and make islands unsuitable for ground nesting birds. The removal activity maintains the wildlife value and protects the important habitat it provides for numerous species of birds and insects.<\/p>\n\n<p>Being coastal, Denge is key for breeding wetland birds, particularly sea birds. Decoy nesting gulls have also been installed to encourage Black Headed Gulls and Common Tern to nest in safe nonoperational areas, on the shingle islands. The team have monitored the site for bryophyte plants (such as moss, liverworts and hornworts) with a view to managing the negative impacts of invasive non-native species. One such species is Crassula Helmsii (New Zealand \u2013 Stonecrop), which can form dense, tangled growth of stems underwater, on the shoreline. These choke out native wildlife, such as the endangered Sussex Emerald moth currently found in one area of Dungeness, where it lives in vegetated shingle.<br />\nOver the last year, the team at Denge have spotted 158 species of wildlife, including birds such as Gadwall, Tufted Duck, Little Grebe, Black Headed Gull and Common Tern and three types of reptile: Adder, Grass Snake and Common Lizard.<br />\nFor 2021 and beyond, a comprehensive list of actions have been decided, and these include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Creating fish reefs using large willow<\/li>\n\t<li>Creating areas of wild carrot, fenced, to prevent rabbits<\/li>\n\t<li>Profiling margins for reedbed growth<\/li>\n\t<li>Checking of gabion baskets and island stability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>With these actions, the site\u2019s wider BMP (BAP) will help ensure that Denge provides a diverse and developing environment for wildlife.<br />\nWell done to all those at the site and in the UK Sustainability team who are working hard to enhance Denge\u2019s eco credentials!&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>The scientific name of the Sand Martin, Riparia, means \u201criverbank.\u201d With their traditional home being sandy sided riverbanks; so their food consists of small insects, mostly gnats and other flies that are associated with waterways and lakes. However, any steep sided sand bank is potential a nesting site. If you manage a site with sand or even dust piles that attract sand martins, there are two key measures to follow; firstly maintain an area suitable for their nesting with a sheer sand face, away from operational activities, and secondly keep operational sand piles sloped at 45 degrees or less to ensure the sand martins don\u2019t choose working piles as their new nest site.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although sand martins are maintaining a healthy population that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t face several challenges. One of the amazing facts about sand martins is their migration, they winter in east and southern Africa by crossing the Sahara Desert nonstop (as there\u2019s nowhere to feed!). The Sahara is the largest desert in the world, measuring approximately 3,000 miles from east to west and 1,200 miles from north to south. Before crossing the Sahara Desert, the Sand Martins store up just enough fat to keep them going through the journey without needing to refuel. Without enough fat, they won\u2019t have the energy to make the crossing, but if they store too much fat they\u2019ll be weighed down and their flight won\u2019t be efficient. &nbsp;All of this is from a bird that is just 12-14cm long, weighs 13.5g and lives on gnats! Knowing this might bring a little more sympathy and admiration for them when you see the Sand Martins return this spring from their 10,000 mile journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>This species originally nested in the steep, sandy banks of rivers, but have adapted to using many different man-made sites with Sand Martins banks often added to CEMEX sites\u2019 restoration schemes.<\/p>\n\n<p>An example of this can be found at Berkswell Quarry in Quarry. Andy Barber, Quarry Manager at Berkswell Quarry, explains: \u201cWe built a Sand Martin \u2018hotel\u2019 at Berkswell a few years ago, to provide somewhere for the birds to nest while protecting our excavation. It now only requires minimal maintenance each year \u2013 the birds tend to arrive on site from April onwards, so before this we scrape the face of the \u2018hotel\u2019 to make sure it is clean and vertical. As soon as the birds start arriving, we leave it alone. There are around 60 holes on the \u2018hotel\u2019 for the Sand Martins to nest in and generally we see about 50-60 pairs using it each year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re lovely little birds and it\u2019s interesting to watch them return each year \u2013 they often seem to return to the same hole. It\u2019s phenomenal how they create their nests really and its great that they can have a safe haven with us. We should be doing what we can to help the wildlife that uses our sites \u2013 it\u2019s important to get the balance between maintaining habitats and continuing our operations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The birds seem to be returning a little slower this year, perhaps because it is quite cold for April. We always look forward to welcoming them back to our site!\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>As we saw at Denge previously, the Covid pandemic has impacted the amount of biodiversity work that could be done over the last year, but the team have still made good progress.<\/p>\n\n<p>In particular, two areas were restored during 2020. This includes a large section of land close to the eastern site boundary and also a section near the weighbridge, just north west of the lake. Both areas will regenerate naturally \u2013 the smaller area near the weighbridge has had brash from heather cutting spread on it to encourage lowland dry heath growth. Some work along the southern boundary was also carried out, to cut heather and remove gorse bushes to prevent succession to scrub.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both of these areas are expected to become lowland dry heath and or lowland acid grassland habitats. In total, the area of land restored comes to 2.2 hectares. Additionally, contractors treated invasive weeds on site, which was successful; only minimal amounts of ragwort are now present.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over the last year, the team at West Heath have spotted 177 species, with animals including roe deer and badgers, birds such as sand martins, skylark and linnet, as well as rarer nightjar and woodcock birds. Egyptian geese (pictured), mute swan, greylag and canada geese are also frequent visitors.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the year ahead, priorities include monitoring for reptiles alongside ecologists; last year adders, grass snakes, slow worms and common lizards were spotted and future sights could impact restoration plans. There is a reptile refuge in the middle of the site and restoration will see more of this created.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Last year, there were some issues with sand martins nesting in stockpiles and so plans are in place to create new nesting faces for the birds during 2021.<\/p>\n\n<p>Closer attention will also be paid to the 0.5 hectares of mire which are along the southern and western shores of the lake and periodically under water. This area is used by birds for feeding.<br />\nTogether with the RSPB, the team at West Heath are working hard to provide a wide range of different habitats for wildlife. We look forward to seeing how the site develops this year!<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

        "Body": "<ul>\n\t<li>The project aims to generate up to 8% of the cement plant\u2019s electricity needs.<\/li>\n\t<li>The consortium has obtained nearly \u20ac14m funding from the Horizon 2020 Industrial (Waste) Heat to Power conversion call, to drive implementation and testing of the technology over a four year project period starting in June 2021.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Comprising of both profit and non-profit organizations, the consortium will use a special configuration of heat exchangers and heat transfer fluid for higher efficiency. The plant is expected to generate about 2 MW of electrical power, which is around 8% of the cement plant requirements.&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX places Climate Action as a daily priority and supports EU policies towards net zero CO2 targets. As a global group, CEMEX aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 35% by 2030 compared to 1990 and to deliver net zero CO2 concrete by 2050. In 2020 CEMEX\u2019s European operations had reduced CO2 emissions by around 35%, and became the first Company in the sector to align to the EU\u2019s aspiration to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe new sCO2 technology has a smaller footprint and higher operational flexibility than conventional power plant cycles, which produce power from turbines using water or steam. The sCO2 cycles use CO2 that is in a supercritical state - at a temperature and pressure above its critical point where liquid and gas phases are not distinguishable\u201d \u2013 said Karol Czubara, CEMEX\u2019s Prachovice Cement Plant Director.<br />\nThe project further demonstrates CEMEX\u2019s clear Climate Action strategy which shows further progression on upscaling ground breaking technologies to decarbonise the business and meet EU and CEMEX climate targets.<br />\nMore information on the project and the consortium partners can be found at:&nbsp;<a

        "Body": "<p>The RSPB worked with CEMEX to restore the site using best practice conservation techniques, CEMEX and RSPB staff took part in the event, scattering heather brash from a local SSSI heathland at Sutton Park, by hand in inaccessible areas and machine in flatter locations.&nbsp;<br />\nThe heather brash is cuttings of heather that contain tiny seeds- propagules (dust like). The benefit of using brash is that other heath species will also be collected and spread, along with any associated microbes. There are lots of little-understood interactions between plants and microbes, and this method gives the new potential seedlings the best shot at establishing well. &nbsp;Once the brash is scattered you just wait and see.&nbsp;<br />\nHeather potentially germinates twice a year, but the soil pH, weather and moisture conditions need to be right. In the spring following brash scattering we had a late severe snowy cold snap named \u2018beast from the east\u2019 1 and 2 - bringing snow into May. Plus, we\u2019ve had exceptionally dry springs with little or no rain, followed by poor summers and wet winters! Luckily heather seeds last a very long time, (Heather seeds have a half-life of circa 50-60 years i.e. half the seeds are viable for 50-60yrs) some, found at archaeological sites have been known to germinate after a thousand years.&nbsp;<br />\nLast year in 2020 we had started to get very concerned that perhaps there was something wrong at site \u2013 some other reason for the lack of germination, and found that on part of the land some on the deeper subsoils under that\u2019s sandy topsoil we\u2019re not the ideal pH. &nbsp;However, site was always intended to be a heathland mosaic of features and not wall to wall heather so we weren\u2019t too concerned.&nbsp;<br />\nThen last month a site visit brought us all a feeling of Joy\u2026. HEATHER at last, upwards of 100 first year heather seedlings. We were relieved and over the moon \u2013 such positive signs of things to come.&nbsp;<br />\nJust shows if we do the right thing, be patient and nature will come up trumps when we give it chance.<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>"

The system is currently live at 39 sites, and is being used 2,000 times a week, with that figure steadily increasing week on week.<br />\nCEMEX has made this commitment to nationwide rollout of mp connect because it will help to streamline its own processes and enhance management of hauliers and contractors. It will ensure all drivers meet legislative and site requirements and enable the business to continually raise standards and lead the industry in safety and compliance.<br />\nDave Hart, Supply Chain Director for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cSafety is CEMEX\u2019s number one priority and we are always looking for ways to make our processes in this area more streamlined and effective.

For this spectacular achievement, CEMEX delivered more than 40,000 m3 of concrete, including low carbon formulations, and removed 42,000 tonnes or spoil materials via its multimodal transport network.<br />\nThese multi-use skyscrapers presented huge technical challenges to the construction team as they are inclined at an angle of 5° (more than the leaning tower of Pisa) and were built on a very narrow site. The foundations, diaphragm walls and nine basement levels required specialist concrete to enable long six-hour pours and high-quality facings.<br />\nOf the 40,000 m3 of ready-mixed concrete supplied from local CEMEX units, 25% was for concrete foundations for diaphragm walls, and 75% for civil engineering and architectural concrete for elevations. The client also required high-performance concrete for pouring a mega-beam supporting all the towers and with an integrated cooling system. The latter was &nbsp; designed and delivered by the Paris Port-Victor production unit. All the concrete was designed with formulations to reduce the building's carbon footprint, in particular for the foundations.&nbsp;<br />\nIn 2021, 150 m3 of black decorative concrete was pumped for the construction of the terraces of the two towers, while fast-drying anhydrite screed was installed on nearly 2,000 m² of heated floors. In addition, during these three years, thanks to its robust multimodal logistics system, CEMEX will have evacuated almost all of the spoil - nearly 42,000 tonnes.<br />\nThe strong commitment of CEMEX's technical teams ensured the success of the operation. For a complex project like this, excellent communication between the various CEMEX departments (commercial, technical, production) and the concrete manufacturing teams enabled smooth and consistent concrete deliveries during long days and weekends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Any pallets damaged beyond repair are recycled. Nationwide collections are available within 10 working days on average from request, with capacity for up to 250 pallets (550 pallets for an articulated vehicle) per load, but can be as few as 50 pallets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Graeme Barton, National Sales Manager Packed Cement, CEMEX, commented: \u201cWe want to make life easier for our merchants to work with us to reduce waste. We\u2019d like to make pallet recovery part of the standard delivery process, as many pallets still end up in landfill. It is increasingly costly to dispose of pallet waste and there is far greater value to be gained by recycling and reuse. Rising timber costs, combined with pallet shortages, means there is a heightened need to conserve and maintain pallets throughout the supply chain. Recovery is considerably more cost effective than buying new replacements.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cPallets are a standard format in transporting building products and contribute a significant financial and environmental cost which needs to be captured by the user. We saw a similar situation with supermarkets and plastic bags, but we\u2019d rather not wait for legislation to enforce this, we\u2019d really like to make a difference now with preventative action. The pallet recovery service is regenerative by design and aims to support the key principals of the circular economy to benefit business, society and the environment. If we all pull together it will have a significant impact across the whole supply chain.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

The pre-fabricated track embedded in concrete (supplied by CEMEX\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions business) was chosen for this development to ensure a quick turnaround of work, keeping outages down and minimising the impact on the customer.&nbsp;<br />\nMark Grimshaw Smith, Rail and Sea Manager for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cThe summer months have provided us with the perfect opportunity to complete a considerable programme of investment into track at three of our rail depots. These sites are all very different, and spread out across the country, but they are all important parts of our rail network and ripe for development.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cAs our use of trains to transport our materials increases, it is vital that we have the infrastructure in place to support this. Further investment is planned at some of our other UK railheads over the coming months.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s use of trains to move its building materials is growing year on year, with considerable efforts being made by the business to switch from road freight to rail and sea.

More than 220M buildings in Europe representing approximately 85% of the building stock built before 2021 will mostly still be standing in 2050, yet currently only 1% of buildings undergo energy-efficient renovation every year. The energy performance of buildings is a major area for improvement in public policies, for new build and the renovation of the existing stock. From residential housing, to public buildings and urban schemes, across the board we\u2019re demonstrating to our customers that by improving the built environment, we can significantly improve our natural environment too.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cConcrete has a critical role to play in the transition to a Low-Carbon Economy. We have the aspiration to deliver net zero CO2 concrete globally by 2050, which will contribute to the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings and climate resilient infrastructures.

CEMEX has also committed to reduce its indirect electricity GHG emissions (scope 2) by 42% by 2030 from a 2020 base year.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cClimate action is the biggest challenge of our times. CEMEX is taking decisive action to address it by defining ambitious emissions reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative and executing against those targets,\u201d said Fernando A.

CEMEX is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Under its Future in Action program, CEMEX announced a climate action target of below 475 kg CO2, a &gt;40% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. The company´s clean electricity consumption will also increase from the current 29% in 2020 to 55% by 2030.

The two key objectives of the Bank Station Capacity Upgrade project are to increase capacity at the station and minimise journey times. More than 1200m of new tunnels have already been built, including three new escalator barrels.<br />\nCEMEX was contracted to provide high quality primary lining spray concrete for use in the construction of shafts, tunnels and cross passages, with four 100 tonne silos on site for storage. This job has presented particular challenges because of its location in a very busy area of London, while the station itself is remaining operational throughout construction.&nbsp;<br />\nDeliveries must be booked in advance and precisely timed, following pre-agreed routes through the City of London. However, there are still many pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users using the area at all times, which present a considerable risk that must be closely managed. CEMEX worked closely with Dragados to design a site layout which enabled regular delivery of dry silo materials while minimising disruption to the traffic or pedestrians.<br />\nThe project requires strategic management and coordination by CEMEX\u2019s plant, silo, supply chain and booking teams to ensure product is produced and delivered safely and to schedule.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, the mix supplied is extremely complicated, consisting of eight separate constituents which when combined give strength of +60N/mm2, consistence of 600mm flow and a workability retention of two hours. This mix has been used on several high-profile London projects over the last seven years including the Northern Line Extension and Thames Tideway.<br />\nMichael May, Sales Manager for CEMEX Mortars Europe, commented: \u201cSupplying the Bank station development has presented considerable challenges, particularly around access, but we are very proud of the dedication of our team to ensuring the specific mix of concrete was produced and safely delivered to meet the customer\u2019s requirements.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cIt is a privilege to be part of such a major construction project in our capital city and the spray concrete we have created has become renowned across the industry for its high quality and exceptional finish.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX manufactures the product at a dedicated spray concrete plant from where it is transported into central London.

        "Body": "<p>This effort, which aims to decarbonize the cement manufacturing process based on solar energy, is part of CEMEX's roadmap for its ambitious climate action goals, including delivering globally net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050. This is one of several initiatives under the company\u2019s Future in Action program, which focuses on investing today in the promising technologies that the company will need to achieve its ultimate goal of net-zero concrete by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>Based in Switzerland, Synhelion offers a radically new approach to replace fossil fuels in cement plants with high-temperature solar heat and capture 100 percent of carbon emissions. The captured emissions are then utilized as feedstock for fuel production, enabling cement manufacturing to achieve net-zero emissions. This is made possible by Synhelion\u2019s proprietary technology, which allows it to achieve an extremely high temperature by solar heat and its pioneering process to turn CO2 into synthetic solar fuels that several transportation industries can use.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Synhelion's technology has enormous potential; not only does it close the fuel carbon cycle, but it also facilitates a carbon-free cement industry. This investment is another example of the innovative projects and technologies we develop to decarbonize the industry,\" said Gonzalo Galindo, Head of CEMEX Ventures.<\/p>\n\n<p>This funding round was led by Swiss KMU Partners with participation from other venture capital firms, including Orchiila, SMS Concat, AMAG, and CEMEX Ventures. Synhelion will use the funding to build and operate what should be the world's first plant capable of producing solar fuels at an industrial scale.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ends.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.
