        "Body": "<p>Following a significant investment and the completion of major infrastructure works the new depot, which is located in Small Heath, has welcomed its first train and moving forward will receive aggregates from CEMEX\u2019s Dove Holes Quarry. From there, the material will be transported out to construction projects in the Birmingham market.&nbsp;<br />\nDave Hart, Supply Chain Director for the UK and France, commented: \u201cAs the UK\u2019s second largest city, Birmingham plays an important role in our strategy to focus on metro markets and the opening of this depot will allow us to increase volume and service provision \u2013 we are anticipating four trains per week will pass through this depot.<br />\n\u201cHowever, the opening of the Small Heath rail depot will not just allow us to further grow our business; it also offers considerable sustainability benefits as it will enable us to maximise the use of rail as a more efficient means of transport for our products. Potentially, this depot could mean 17,000 less trucks on the road each year, with an approximate annual CO2 saving of 2,200 tonnes.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX has partnered with GB Railfreight, Network Rail and leading aggregates distributor GRS to ensure a smooth operation and service at its Small Heath depot.&nbsp;<br />\nLiam Day, Commercial Director of GB Railfreight, said: \u201cWith the global climate change conference currently underway, CEMEX\u2019s investment in its new depot demonstrates the key role rail freight is playing in reducing the impact of carbon emissions. This increase in capacity will enable us to operate more trains into Small Heath and will remove congestion from some of Birmingham\u2019s busiest roads.\u201d<br />\nDavid Young, Network Rail's Business Development Manager for Freight, added: \"Network Rail\u2019s investment in the infrastructure was pivotal in supporting the delivery of CEMEX\u2019s new rail aggregate depot at Small Heath. We are proud to have worked with CEMEX to enable rail freight growth in this important sector, encourage modal shift from road to rail and support decarbonisation targets.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Martin Reid, Director of GRS Rail Services, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be working with CEMEX to help to supply Birmingham\u2019s construction industry with materials for redevelopment. The new facilities at Small Health support the use of rail freight to bring construction aggregates close to where they\u2019re needed in the city whilst generating a fraction of the emissions of the equivalent road journeys.\"<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s use of trains to move its building materials is growing year on year, with considerable efforts being made by the business to switch from road freight to rail and sea. In 2020, the increased use of rail transport saved 150,000 road movements &amp; 17.5kt of CO2 from being released into the air.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ends.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

It is the world\u2019s thinnest material, one million times smaller than the diameter of a single human hair. It also believed to be one of the strongest [200 times stronger than steel] and most conductive in existence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Its potential benefits to the construction industry are considerable; graphene-reinforced concrete could use much less cement to deliver the desired strength. As a result, it may reduce CO2 emissions by 983 pounds per ton, according to one estimate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, graphene concrete improves compressive strength, flexural strength, and split tensile strength. A more resilient concrete cracks less, and it better resists stress. More crack-resistant concrete lasts longer, and it requires less maintenance.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Technical and Commercial teams worked closely with Nationwide Engineering and developers, the Mayfield Partnership, to combine our concrete with graphene, and then supply 96m3 of this for the site in Manchester, a planned entertainment venue being opened by the owners of the legendary Hacienda nightclub.<\/p>\n\n<p>Danny Roberts, Readymix Commercial Manager, commented: \u201cThis is the first structural element in the UK that has incorporated graphene into the concrete mix.<\/p>\n\n<p>The pour went like a dream, and we have had lots of positive feedback from the client.

        "Body": "<p>Representatives from an AONB, a CEMEX Kensworth quarry, golf course, and their respective RSPB partnership counterparts met recently to discuss the landscape opportunities available and how we progress and work together on these chalk sites. The vision is of habitats that extend and complement each other across all land uses. On the golf course, areas out of play already provide some fantastic wildflower areas and dense scrub. Future restoration plans for the quarry includes extensive chalk grassland, butterfly banks areas of bare chalk that will naturally succeed creating pioneer / early successional habitat along with ponds and scrub. This combination of habitats provides habitat for a range of species including those scarce and declining species that are known to occur locally like Duke of Burgundy and in the recent past Turtle Doves.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Chilterns AONB extends from Reading up to Luton and at its northern end includes Dunstable Downs and Whipsnade SSSI, managed by the National Trust, these sites are literally just across the road from both Dunstable Downs Golf Course and CEMEX Kensworth quarry. The RSPB has been working with CEMEX for over 10 years and closely with Kensworth over the last two years, to reprioritise their restoration scheme, which was originally earmarked for woodland and agricultural grassland \u2013 for a chalk site this would clearly have been a lost opportunity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Working so closely with the quarry we\u2019ve generated support from them. A casual conversation by the Site Manager with the golf course next door has built wider connections. Dunstable Downs Golf Course are keen to enhance their site for nature, utilising the skills from RSPB partnerships with the R&amp;A and quarry. The aspiration being to restore their original chalk downland characteristics and chalk grassland species and wildflowers to their \u2018long rough \u2013 as these characteristics were lost due to the graduation towards a parkland course many years earlier.<\/p>\n\n<p>The RSPB and the quarry have built connections with the BCN Wildlife Trust and contacted the National Trust to facilitate green haying. Combined, the advice and wealth of local knowledge will input into enhancement at both the golf course and the quarry \u2013 an excellent result already! However, we have also connected with the Chilterns Conservation Board as part of the Chilterns AONB, linking in with a Chalkscapes landscape bid.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are always opportunities for different landowners to work together to share knowledge and form that connected network. Certainly, for the partnership RSPB/CEMEX we hope to replicate this working with stakeholders at other CEMEX sites, whether that be working with local RSPB reserve or with other landowners or other conservation charities.<\/p>"

It is the only buyers club working to scale new technologies across the heavy industry and heavy-duty transport sectors.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d), roughly half of the emission reductions needed to reach the critical 2050 climate target of keeping the global temperature increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius, when compared to pre-industrial levels, rely on new and emerging technologies. The FMC will create new markets and promote growth by leveraging collective demand and purchasing commitments for zero emission goods and services by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWith its Future in Action program, CEMEX is committed to lead on the road to carbon neutrality. We are proud to join forces with the World Economic Forum and other global companies to accelerate the development of critical new decarbonizing technologies. Our shared goals and the investments announced today would not be possible without the steadfast leadership shown throughout this process by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and the World Economic Forum,\u201d said CEMEX CEO Fernando A. González.<\/p>\n\n<p>The coalition will work across eight key sectors. Seven of these sectors \u2014steel, cement, aluminum, chemicals, shipping, aviation, and trucking\u2014account for more than a third of global carbon emissions, but do not currently have cost-competitive energy alternatives to fossil fuels.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese companies will be critical partners in pushing for commercially viable alternatives to decarbonize these industrial sectors and more,\u201d US President Joe Biden noted during a speech at the \u201cAccelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment\u201d event at COP26 Tuesday.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cTechnology has given us the tools to reduce our emissions and build a stronger and more inclusive economy of the future,\u201d said Børge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum. \u201cFor innovators and investors to play their part in tackling the climate crisis, they need clear market demand. The First Movers Coalition will leverage the collective purchasing power of leading companies and drive the need for these technologies.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Under its Future in Action program, CEMEX has committed to the most aggressive 2030 decarbonization goals in the heavy building materials industry, and its ambition to deliver net zero CO2 concrete globally by 2050. While the program relies on proven technology to reach its 2030 goals, it includes a focus on innovation and partnership to develop and scale the new technologies needed to fully decarbonize the cement and concrete businesses by 2050. Among them are investments in solar fuel pioneer Synhelion, and agreements with Volvo for electro-mobility solutions and BP to collaborate on potential solutions including clean electricity and low carbon fuels and transportation.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to being a founding member of the FMC, CEMEX has joined the United Nation\u2019s Race to Zero campaign and the Business Ambition for 1.5°C coalition.

        "Body": "<p>In Split, Croatia, CEMEX organised a volunteering activity in the olive groves located in its quarry, in cooperation with the Agricultural and Veterans' Cooperative Lintar. In a few hours, seven teams of five to six volunteers managed to break the daily harvesting record with 1,162 kg of olives harvested. Almost 6.5 tonnes of olives were collected, from which 900 litres of eco-certified extra virgin olive oil will be produced. CEMEX also involved students from two local community primary schools to help with the olive harvest.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, restored quarries in CEMEX\u2019s Spanish operation provided additional examples of successful horticulture and environmental enrichment from productive restoration. The former \u2018El Clotet\u2019 quarry in Alicante, Spain, is now a 138-hectare agricultural holding with more than 55,000 fruit trees. The farm has started to collect more than 2,000 tonnes of citrus fruits for the national and export market, beginning in October and running until May.<br />\nRafael Sempere, head of CEMEX's agricultural division in Spain, explained: \u201cThis restored quarry is an example of a sustainable, environmentally friendly farm that uses the latest irrigation techniques to avoid wasting a single drop of water, a very valuable resource in Spain.\u201d<br />\nAnother pioneering project is CEMEX\u2019s vineyard, located in the former quarry of the Yepes cement factory near Toledo. Thirty hectares of land and 92,000 plants of the best grape varieties are cultivated in a restored natural environment. The production of grapes and wine from this site demonstrates how properly restored industrial land can provide agricultural production of benefit to both the local community and the natural habitat.<br />\nAndrew Spencer, VP of Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX EMEA added: \u201cWe recognise that our industry has consequences for the environment, but CEMEX is working hard to actively counteract climate change and this drive is present through all aspects of our business. In our cement and aggregate quarrying operations across Europe, we restore and recultivate our sites to provide optimal conditions that are managed well to deliver for biodiversity. The recent harvests in Croatia and Spain in particular demonstrate how valuable this can be, both for wildlife and for local communities. Our vision is of a successful, sustainable CEMEX that makes a positive contribution to people and the environment.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX takes responsibility for the environment in its operations by improving management systems, reducing emissions, protecting biodiversity, and restoring worked-out quarries to nature and agriculture. Employees, subcontractors and local communities maintain awareness of sustainable habitats, for instance by organising volunteer activities at our sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ends&nbsp;<br />\nAbout CEMEX<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX is a global building materials company that cares about a better future for future generations through sustainable products and solutions.

If the proposed extension is permitted by the County Council and gravel extraction begins in this area, the resulting lake, though larger than the one being formed by the existing scheme, would only occupy a small part of Fish Meadow.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe proposed lake would not affect the holding of future festivals on the meadow, and in fact the owner sees it as an enhancement that will make the site a more attractive venue. For the short time work is in progress there will be some inconvenience but it is the ambition of all parties concerned that this is minimised with the least effect on the festivals.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are working closely with Upton Rowing Club and other stakeholders and hope that the lake could be imaginatively and sensitivity managed to enhance the site for the benefit of the whole local area.

(\u201cCEMEX\u201d) and COBOD International (\u201cCOBOD\u201d), a global leader in construction-grade 3D printers, announced today the introduction of a 3D printing solution that utilizes conventional ready-mix concrete in the building process. The solution allows for a reduction in time and significant savings versus traditional construction and other 3D printing methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>Utilizing an innovative admixture, CEMEX and COBOD developed a solution for 3D printing that enables the use of conventional concrete, allowing the consumption of local and readily available materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current 3D printing methods rely on highly specialized and expensive mortars. CEMEX introduced a proprietary admixtures family called D.fab, which transforms conventional concrete into a versatile material that can be efficiently tailored for 3D printing construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>This admixtures innovation produces a more fluid and malleable concrete that facilitates the pouring process for 3D printing applications. COBOD\u2019s printers and expertise, in combination with the admixtures, make it possible for the concrete to gain shape instantaneously. COBOD applied the new solution for the first time in a suburb of Luanda, the capital of Angola, where homebuilder Power2Build used it to construct Angola\u2019s first 3D printed concrete house.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe introduction of this revolutionary 3D printing system is a testament to our customer-centric mindset and relentless focus on continuous innovation and improvement. Working together with COBOD, we have developed an experience for customers that is superior to anything that has been provided in the past,\u201d said Juan Romero, Executive Vice President Sustainability, Commercial, and Operations Development of CEMEX. \u201cOur innovation efforts position us at the forefront of new technologies that contribute to building a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo address the world´s affordable housing needs requires not only a technology that can build faster, but also materials that are as economical as ordinary concrete. With this solution, the strength and quality of concrete combined with the speed and automation of 3D printing, we can help solve the affordable housing crisis in Angola and elsewhere,\u201d said Ricardo Almeida, CEO of Power2Build.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cCOBOD began 3D construction printing back in 2017, and 3D printed Europe\u2019s first 3D printed building, we made the concrete recipe ourselves. We had to use much cement to get the material to work, with the consequence that our recipe was not as efficient as we aspired. However, we continued to look for a solution with ordinary concrete, which is critical for the mass application of our technology.

        "Body": "<p>The CFO Taskforce for the SDGs has three main goals: to engage the global CFO community, to integrate the SDGs into strategy, financing, and investor relations, and to create a broad sustainable finance market. Members of the UN Global Compact CFO Taskforce for the SDGs aim to:<\/p>\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Provide the global development community with a modern view of how capital markets can contribute to financing the SDGs, at scale.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop innovative financial instruments and contribute to a broad market of diversified investment opportunities for the SDGs.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Support companies in securing the financial capital needed to implement the SDGs and transform their business and production models.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Connect companies\u2019 SDG investments with increasingly impact-oriented investors.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop internal tools and resources to embed sustainability in corporate finance, including strategic alignment, impact measurement, reporting, investor communication, and financial innovation.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Promote partnerships between CEOs and CFOs and help translate sustainability strategies into financial language for investors and rating agencies.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cClimate change is perhaps the biggest challenge of our times, affecting lives and disrupting economies. Only by aligning our financial and climate action strategies will we be able to overcome this challenge,\u201d said Maher Al-Haffar, CFO of CEMEX. \u201cAt CEMEX, we share the beliefs embodied in the CFO Principles and are honored to join the UN Global Compact CFO Taskforce for the SDGs through which we will actively contribute to the innovation of corporate finance that will enable the building of a more resilient future for all.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The CFO Taskforce for the SDGs is working with the whole investment value chain, including investors, banks, development finance institutions, credit rating agencies, and sustainability assessment firms, to create a broad, liquid, and efficient market for SDG investments and capital flows. Efficient capital markets can encourage companies to experiment with and improve upon a wide range of sustainability solutions, and over time, help identify the most effective ways to contribute to the SDGs.<\/p>\n\n<p>To drive the commitment of billions, and potentially trillions, of corporate finance towards the SDGs, the UN Global Compact CFO Taskforce has created a comprehensive management and governance framework, The CFO Principles for Integrated SDG Investments and Finance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>About the UN Global Compact CFO Taskforce<br />\nThe UN Global Compact CFO Taskforce was launched by the UN Global Compact in December 2019 with a small group of leading CFOs to build on the work developed by the Financial Innovation for the SDGs Action Platform. Its goal is to inspire a new meaning for the role of CFOs as the architects of long- term sustainable value creation by raising awareness of the transformative impact of corporate finance across financial markets, the global economy and society as a whole. It also aspires to create a market for corporate SDG investments and finance that is sufficiently diverse and transparent to channel trillions of dollars of financial investments towards effective private-sector solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals. The CFO Taskforce provides CFOs with a platform to share ideas, develop new concepts and frameworks, and provide recommendations to unlock private capital and create a market for mainstream SDG investments.

The introduction of ReadyBlock Zero represents an important and timely step for industry ahead of new legislation and the Future Homes Standard. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>ReadyBlock Zero offers housebuilders and developers the opportunity to build lower carbon developments, without compromising on product quality or strength. The new CarbonNeutral® block looks identical to a traditional concrete block and the only difference is it embodies up to 80% less carbon, with the remaining carbon offset. To do this we are working with Natural Capital Partners, an award-winning expert on carbon neutrality and climate finance, that is harnessing the power of business to create a more sustainable world.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carl Platt, Urbanization Solutions Director of Asphalt, Paving and Building Products for Europe, commented: \u201cWe have developed the UK\u2019s first CarbonNeutral® concrete block to help housebuilders get ahead of the game when it comes to building low carbon homes that meet and exceed Government guidelines and changes to building regulations. We want to make life easier for housebuilders to make simple sustainable choices that make largescale impacts on the often complex road to Net Zero. Concrete blocks are the most common structural component in the construction of UK homes, so by switching to zero carbon blocks, ReadyBlock Zero presents a huge opportunity for housebuilders to make significant carbon reductions.\u201d &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s Climate Action strategy aims to lead the way in the construction industry and has an overall global ambition of delivering net zero carbon emissions in concrete by 2050.

This has been a fantastic experience having previously struggled to find sea time to complete my training due to COVID-19. As the months passed, it looked less and less likely that I would be able qualify in the next few years, despite having completed my Foundation Degree in Marine Engineering at nautical college. However, through my mentor from the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, Captain Matt Bland, I had the opportunity to join this vessel and complete my training.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the early stages of my cadetship I spent some time on a deep-sea containership. Although I found this interesting, it was not necessarily a good learning environment. In comparison, CEMEX UK Marine has been an excellent organisation in which to learn my trade. Not only have I made good progress on the completion of my Training Record Book, but the crew have been actively willing to teach me in a way I haven\u2019t encountered before.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, I think this vessel is an excellent learning environment for cadets. In a matter of weeks I have experienced a variety of engine room maintenance procedures, emergency drills, maintenance on deck machinery and even observed some bridge operations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I have been impressed with the procedures at CEMEX, which create a safe environment to work in. I have also had the chance to assist in the completion of crucial documentation including Permits to Work and Lock-Out paperwork under the supervision of the Chief Engineer. Having not come across the important initiatives like \u201cStep In\u201d, Near-Miss Hazard Alert Cards and Work Safe Risk Assessments on a vessel before, I can see how these contribute to the excellent safety culture at CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>I would like to give thanks to Matt, the Officers and Crew, and CEMEX UK for this fantastic opportunity. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of my time onboard!\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>Clinker is produced by fusing together limestone, clay, and other materials in a rotary kiln at temperatures nearing 1,500°C. Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln and they are responsible for approximately 40% of direct CO2 emissions of the process. Replacing fossil fuels entirely with solar energy is a gamechanger in the industry\u2019s efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cThe production of the first solar clinker is an exciting milestone for this transformational technology. It is proof of our commitment to deliver tangible outcomes through innovation to achieve our goal of delivering only net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050,\u201d said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX. \u201cCEMEX is building a better future, and that future must be sustainable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The Synhelion and CEMEX R&amp;D teams set up a pilot batch production unit to produce clinker from concentrated solar radiation by connecting the clinker production process with the Synhelion solar receiver. The pilot was installed at the Very High Concentration Solar Tower of IMDEA Energy, located in Spain. Synhelion\u2019s solar receiver delivers record-breaking temperatures reaching beyond 1,500°C. The solar receiver heats a gaseous heat transfer fluid and thus provides the necessary process heat for clinker production.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur technology converts concentrated sunlight into the hottest existing solar process heat \u2013 beyond 1,500°C \u2013 on the market,\u201d said Dr. Gianluca Ambrosetti, CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. \u201cWe are proud to demonstrate together with CEMEX one specific industrially relevant application of our fully renewable, high-temperature solar heat.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The pilot is the first successful calcination and, more importantly, the first successful clinkerization ever achieved using only solar energy. The clinker was used to produce cement and was then further processed to produce concrete. In the next phase of their joint research and development project, CEMEX and Synhelion aim to produce solar clinker in larger quantities as they work towards an industrial scale pilot at a cement plant.<\/p>\n\n<p>This initiative is part of CEMEX\u2019s Future in Action program, which focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of its operations and products to deliver globally net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050. An essential part of this strategy is CEMEX Ventures and its R&amp;D Center in Switzerland.

        "Body": "<p>SDSA is a professional stage show that has been running in the UK since 2000 and was introduced to Rugby School in 2017.The objective of this road safety initiative is to show young people why, as young drivers, they, and their passengers, are so vulnerable in their early years on the road and what they can do to reduce this vulnerability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Young qualified drivers make up 7% of the total driving population but, disproportionately, are involved in 24% of all serious and fatal crashes. One in six young driver will become involved in a crash within their first two years of driving. This is of great concern to the local authorities, emergency services and most certainly to parents of young drivers and vulnerable road users. To this end, CEMEX SDSA Warwickshire is designed to address these issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>SDSA is fast paced, balancing educational content with real life evidence, factually presented, holding the audience\u2019s attention throughout. It uses testimonies from officers in the emergency services about their real experiences in dealing with the aftermath of serious road crashes; from crash survivors and the bereaved. It also covers Safer and Healthy Mobility, a new section on other forms of transportation used by young people.<\/p>\n\n<p>This year\u2019s event was organised by Rugby resident George Atkinson, a road safety campaigner since his daughter was killed as a pedestrian in London in 1998. George would like to thank CEMEX for their sponsorship and Rugby School for allowing their students to witness this life saving road safety show.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"CEMEX is committed to protecting the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable road users and we feel very honoured to sponsor this year\u2019s Safe Drive Stay Alive event, an impactful and important show that could help to save lives. We recognise the vulnerability of new and young drivers and we hope that this programme will go a long way in influencing the behaviours which can lead to a generation of risk averse drivers.\"<br />\n<strong>Chiedza Mupfumira, Social Impact Specialist for CEMEX UK<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\"It is always a privilege to support George and Giulietta in their tireless and effective campaigning for greater road safety. The CEMEX SDSA Warwickshire stage show is an excellent way in which the realities and vulnerabilities of newly qualified drivers can be conveyed to young people in an educational and balanced way. I hope these lifesaving messages will continue to reach more students in Rugby and beyond.\"<br />\n<strong>Mark Pawsey MP &nbsp;<\/strong><br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX\u2019s key building products plant at Northfleet in Kent has made significant inroads over the last 12 months. This follows on from the recent launch of ReadyBlock Zero, the UK\u2019s first zero carbon concrete block, as CEMEX\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions business continues to improve the sustainability of its operations in line with the company\u2019s global Future In Action strategy, which is committed to Net Zero CO2 in concrete by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>Production equipment at Northfleet has been upgraded through a £100k CapEx investment to enable increased supply and ongoing maintenance. &nbsp;The new high-strength banding process means that plastic hoods are no longer required on dense and lightweight bricks and concrete blocks. As a result, Northfleet has eradicated 6.1 tonnes of plastic, or the equivalent of over 65,000 plastic water bottles, per year from its traditional plastic packaging process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to plastic reduction, Northfleet is continuing to make environmental savings in timber by increasing the volume of void packs which reduces the volume of &nbsp;timber palleted products. &nbsp;Over 100 tonnes of timber \u2013 roughly the equivalent of 100 ten foot high oak trees \u2013 was saved in 2021 and it is expected this figure will increase further in 2022. The programme is further supported by CEMEX\u2019s pallet recovery scheme which works with merchants and distributors to recycle and reduce timber waste across the supply chain to make greater environmental efficiencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nDamien Allen, Business Manager, Building Products UK, CEMEX, comments: \u201cWe have been pushing a more sustainable approach to our packaging in Concrete Products. &nbsp;At our Northfleet plant, our results so far are very encouraging. We expect our usage of plastic and timber to reduce further dramatically in 2022 due to the upgraded process.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur &nbsp;equipment meets the highest quality requirements. It is extremely reliable, requires little maintenance, and is highly energy-efficient as well. We are looking at lots of different options to continuously improve our packaging, without compromising product quality. This includes a constant watching eye on recycled materials and our approach to repair and re-use across the plant, in line with the circular economy mindset.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Climate Action strategy aims to lead the way in the construction industry and has an overall global ambition of delivering net zero carbon emissions in concrete by 2050. CEMEX Urbanisation Solutions is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on the Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>-Ends-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Developed to complement and enhance the design and aesthetics of any architectural or urban scheme, CEMEX ONPOINT is a factory-produced mortar available in over 35 consistent colour palette options, effectively complementing a wide range of masonry products and existing mortar. Guaranteed to not fade and providing high levels of resistance in extreme exposure, CEMEX ONPOINT is suitable for multi-use applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This new product is ideal for offsite and precast panel construction for commercial development, modular housing and residential high rise, as well as for restoration and retrofit projects. The high performance mortar is formulated for gun injection application, providing an additional sustainability benefit by reducing waste and labour costs. It allows quick and efficient pointing of brick inlay systems and brick slip panels, and is equally effective for matching and repointing existing brickwork. Offsite production is seen by many as a more sustainable method of construction because everything is made under strict factory conditions, allowing optimisation of the process and the most efficient use of materials.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Mike May, Sales Manager for Mortars Europe, comments: \u201cWe\u2019re continuously looking at how we can enhance the performance, durability and consistency of our mortars to meet market demand. The off-site market is booming, but precast manufacturers and architectural specifiers are limited in their choice of mortars. The arrival of CEMEX ONPOINT now enables precast manufacturers and specialist designers the ability to dramatically enhance aesthetics and increase the kerb appeal of their buildings via quick and easy gun injction application, which also cuts down on wasted material.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur wide range of colours also make CEMEX ONPOINT the ideal mortar to support sustainable retrofit and restoration. On heritage projects we can now accurately colour-match existing mortars for repointing and maintenance work. Our existing buildings account for more than 35% of the world\u2019s energy consumption, so solutions like CEMEX ONPOINT can significantly contribute to a more efficient built environment and a better future for all.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>All CEMEX Mortars comply with the requirements of BS EN 998-2 and the complete range of masonry mortars have been verified against a prescribed range of initial type tests such as durability, bond strength, fire protection and strength criteria.<\/p>\n\n<p>ONPOINT is the latest addition to CEMEX\u2019s broader Urbanisation Solutions business, which is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on the Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/onpoint-coloured-pointing-mortar\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/onpoint-coloured-pointing-mortar<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

This foot enables the rail to be inclined, allowing trains to run through smoother, resulting in less movement of bearers and ballast and therefore less maintenance time on track. The design\u2019s recess also allows for less torque on the concrete as the forces are against the recess rather than against a steel shoulder. It was imperative that all anchor points within the concrete were at the correct position, correct axis, correct angle and all within 1mm of tolerance.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Terence Clair commented: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my team who played a critical part in this project.&nbsp;CEMEX UK Rail Solutions created complex concrete to tight timelines putting our customers at the centre of all we are.

This foot enables the rail to be inclined, allowing trains to run through smoother, resulting in less movement of bearers and ballast and therefore less maintenance time on track. The design\u2019s recess also allows for less torque on the concrete as the forces are against the recess rather than against a steel shoulder. It was imperative that all anchor points within the concrete were at the correct position, correct axis, correct angle and all within 1mm of tolerance.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Terence Clair commented: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my team who played a critical part in this project.&nbsp;CEMEX UK Rail Solutions created complex concrete to tight timelines putting our customers at the centre of all we are.

        "Body": "<p>As an alternative to steel mesh construction on large scale projects, such as roads and bridges, airports and taxiways, including internal floors, the Macro fibres in CEMEX Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete provides high levels of performance in reinforcement, without compromising on quality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>According to latest figures compiled by The Department for Business and Industrial Trade Strategy, the cost of concrete-reinforcing bars has risen by 43.6 per cent year on year, while the price of fabricated structural steel has risen by 35.9 per cent. This comes on top of rising costs labour and fuel costs across the supply chain, forcing many to be more discerning when making specification, procurement and purchasing decisions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete enables mesh-free reinforcement, without the need for traditional reinforcing bars. It provides a range of comprehensive benefits to the contractor, with faster, safer and more cost-effective construction, alongside the added potential to reduce CO2, by saving on overall embodied carbon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete is designed to enhance post-crack performance and increase impact and abrasion resistance, as well as flexural strength. Fibres are distributed evenly through the mix unlike mesh reinforcement, which requires exact positioning to be effective.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Reinforcing without steel mesh, can save contractors storage and labour time. The reinforcement process means less waste, as concrete is mixed and supplied to exacting standards for the level of reinforcement required and in the right quantities to meet the technical specification of each job. The concrete fibre product is delivered in traditional Readymix vehicles straight to site in a single operation, removing the need for additional specialist equipment and cutting and fixing on site. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete is manufactured to BS EN ISO 9001 and is independently certified under the quality scheme for Ready Mixed Concrete (QSRMC). The fibre mix concrete is carefully controlled and quality-assured in Readymix plants throughout the UK.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX provides bespoke fibre concrete, in both macro and micro and steel Readymix solutions, along with expert technical assistance to ensure quality products are developed for corrosive ground conditions, extreme weather conditions and high strength requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>To find out more about CEMEX\u2019s complete range of Advanced Fibre Reinforced Concrete visit<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/advanced-fibre-reinforced-concrete\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/advanced-fibre-reinforced-concrete<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-&nbsp;<br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

A couple of cars ahead of Pat, a mother and toddler had got out of their car, meanwhile, a motorcyclist was driving between the stationary cars. The toddler ran out between the cars and was unfortunately hit by the motorcyclist. Although his speed was low the child was knocked to the ground.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pat grabbed his first aid kit and rushed to support the injured toddler, distressed mother and motorcyclist. Pat administered first aid on the toddler, bandaging a large cut on his forehead. He also provided comfort to the mother who was in shock and very distressed, and to the young motorcyclist who was also very upset. By staying calm and acting quickly, Pat was able to support the people involved until the emergency services arrived.<\/p>\n\n<p>Pat\u2019s Manager, Nigel Bateman, Senior Operations Manager London, commented: \u201cWe are very proud of what Pat did to ease the situation and administer first aid. This is a great example of good behaviour \u2013 stepping in, staying calm and providing support where needed during a stressful situation. Well done Pat.\u201d<\/p>"

My daughter had her birthday party here \u2013 I know the area really well so it\u2019s great to give back and join in.

You worked so hard to make the place look bigger, more open and very neat and tidy. This will allow us to install more raised beds in the near future and grow even more produce for the local community. We are so impressed that CEMEX encourages and facilitates such volunteering efforts and we commend your positive approach to supporting the community.

Ian encouraged the children to consider the waste that is created every day and the opportunities the circular economy can present to reduce this. &nbsp;<br />\nRugby is the location of CEMEX\u2019s main UK cement plant, which has been part of the town since the 19th Century. CEMEX strives to be a positive member of the local community and works closely with several schools and groups.<br />\nChiedza Mupfumira, Social Impact Specialist for CEMEX UK, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s vital that we encourage our children and young people to understand the challenges we face as a result of climate change and empower them to protect the world of the future. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe were very impressed by the enthusiasm and attentiveness of the children \u2013 they easily grasped the concept of a circular economy and how it can benefit us all. We would like to extend a big thank you to Boughton Leigh Junior School, in particular Mr Gaskell who supported us on the day and all the children who participated.\u201d<br />\nMark Pawsey MP said: \u201cThe interest our young people have in protecting the environment is always very clear and the pupils at Boughton Leigh Junior School were no exception. I was delighted to be able to talk to them about the role which both the government, local businesses and individuals have to play in reusing, reducing and recycling, and CEMEX\u2019s new online learning tools and their game is a great way to engage with kids about building a circular economy. We all need to do more to help the environment and it was really positive to see both the next generation and one of Rugby\u2019s leading businesses working together to do so.\u201d<br />\nPaula Duynstee, Head Teacher at Boughton Leigh Junior School, added: \u201cThe children and staff of Boughton Leigh Junior School were very proud to be invited to take part in this initiative from CEMEX. Having been supported on numerous occasions by their community programme, we thought that it would be a well thought out and worthwhile endeavour, which it was. The children (and staff) were all very excited by the event and enjoyed taking part immensely. We are very proud of our school and the wider experiences and work ethic we offer, so to engage with the wider workforce was an amazing experience for the children, and one of which we will gladly take part again.\u201d<br />\nCllr Ian Courts, Leader of Solihull Borough Council, and Portfolio Holder for Environment at the West Midlands Combined Authority, said: \u201cI was happy to send over a video to support CEMEX\u2019s work with children to highlight the issue of climate change and how they see the circular economy as a way to minimise waste. &nbsp;The issue here is the increasing scarcity of natural resources and how a tiny fraction actually get re-used. &nbsp;We need to reduce our waste and adapt to reuse our materials wherever we can. Our young people can help us create a circular economy as they build their careers and live their lives.<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important that businesses get involved in this work by signing up to the net zero pledge and by helping to educate our children, and the wider public, on how we can all play a part in tackling climate change. I hope the pupils at Boughton Leigh Junior School enjoyed the session and look for to many more children getting a chance to understand how using the ideas of a circular economy can help us all tackle climate change.<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s educational program A Circular World features a fictional team of young people across the globe who need the help of participants to solve different environmental problems. It aims to help children better understand and contribute more to sustainable development, through the transition to the Circular Economy and by promoting a responsible and sustainable lifestyle.<br />\nThe program is free for all to access and uses a multitude of resources to practically understand and address the major sustainability-related challenges facing our society.

Meanwhile, in France the business grew the tonnage of aggregates and landfill moved by river barge by 9%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Across the channel, the UK saw a 3% rise in rail freight volumes. This saved 143,000 road movements and consequently nearly 17kt of CO2 from being released into the air. Since 2012, CEMEX has increased the amount transported by rail freight in its UK operation by 50%. Finally, Spain has grown its export-import volumes moved by ship by over 50% in just one year, an incredible result.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Matt Wild, VP of Supply Chain for CEMEX EMEA, commented: \u201cWe have been clear in our intention to cut the carbon emissions generated through our supply chain by accelerating a modal shift from road to rail, river and sea freight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is therefore very satisfying to see how much our European operations have increased their use of these over the past year, helped by our continued investment into these networks; such as opening a new rail depot in Birmingham, UK.

The fire service then carried out their rescue.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kye commented: \u201cThis was a very worthwhile exercise, not only for the fire service but for our own team.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Chis Wile, Watch Manager, also commented: \u201cKye, I wish to thank yourself your team, and CEMEX, for your cooperation with allowing my team to use your location.&nbsp;The exercise we carried out with the equipment we used was a first for us, so this was fantastic for our own training development.\u201d<\/p>"

This will commence early 2023.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second is for planning permission for the extraction of 175,000 tonnes of sand &amp; gravel from beneath our former plant site at Manor Pit, Baston, and restoration to a small lake with fringe wet woodland, reedbed and acid grassland to the south. Mineral extracted from Baston will be transported to West Deeping for processing. Extraction will commence in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both projects allow for the sustainable development of mineral resources resulting in social, economic and environmental benefits to the local and wider communities and will extend the life of the current West Deeping operations.<\/p>"
