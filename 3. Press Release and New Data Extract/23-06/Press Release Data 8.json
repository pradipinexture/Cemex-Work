After revising for months, supported by the officers on the Sand Fulmar, I passed and was awarded my Engineer Officer of the Watch Certificate of Competency.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was delighted to then be offered the chance to come back on board as a 4<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;Engineering Officer aboard the Sand Fulmar.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing, I am just over a week into my first trip as a qualified Officer and I have enjoyed the step up from the role of Cadet. The extra responsibility can be challenging at first but also very rewarding. I have found that every day is different, with plenty of opportunities to learn more. My time as Cadet has definitely allowed for a smooth transition to Officer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking back, it feels like only yesterday that I first set foot on board as an inexperienced Cadet and I am grateful to now be in this position.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am thankful for the support from my mentor, Captain Matt Bland and CEMEX Marine UK, as well as the crew of the Sand Fulmar for their support!\u201d<\/p>"

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX and COBOD have been working together over the last year to innovate in the 3D printing space. Through this partnership, they recently introduced the first ever 3D printing solution that utilizes conventional ready-mix concrete in the building process. The solution can deliver significant savings versus traditional 3D printing construction methods and materials and has been implemented in several geographies. Through this investment, CEMEX will strengthen its ability to use 3D printing technology and add another avenue to address housing needs. CEMEX and COBOD also intend to further develop innovative material solutions and building performance enhancements for 3D printing applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current 3D printing construction methods rely on highly specialized and expensive mortars. CEMEX introduced a proprietary admixtures family called D.fab, which allows conventional concrete to be efficiently tailored for 3D printing construction. This admixtures innovation produces a more fluid and easier to pump concrete that facilitates 3D printing applications. COBOD\u2019s printers and expertise, in combination with the admixtures, make it possible to implement a more efficient process that requires less material and utilizes any concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe investment in COBOD reflects our customer-centric mindset and relentless focus on continuous innovation and improvement. Working with COBOD, CEMEX developed a customer experience in 3D printing construction that is superior to anything that has been provided in the past,\u201d said Gonzalo Galindo, Head of CEMEX Ventures. \u201cOur innovation efforts position us at the forefront of new technologies that contribute to building a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am proud to have CEMEX, a global leader in the building materials industry, join us as an investor along with our other shareholders PERI and GE Renewable Energy. CEMEX is already an important partner to us. Together, we have already improved 3D construction printing tremendously with the successful D.fab solution and we intend to continue to develop new, innovative materials to build a better future through material solutions for 3D printing applications that significantly reduce construction costs and time\u201d, said Henrik-Lund Nielsen, Founder &amp; General Manager of COBOD. 2<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About COBOD<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>COBOD\u2019s mission is to disrupt the global construction industry through world class multifunctional construction robots based on 3D printing systems.

        "Body": "<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Over 50 cement truck drivers, working from the Rugby, South Ferriby and Tilbury plants have used the Blackline G7 safety system for the last year. This solution is the only one in the world that offers work-anywhere wireless, two-way voice communication, monitoring for health events, gas leaks and injuries. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">They are ideal for those who are lone-working, particularly at night-time when drivers may feel more vulnerable. CEMEX\u2019s main priority is ensuring the health and safety of all its employees and contractors, and it has now decided to explore implementation of the system for those working with readymix trucks in the south, and some of those in the asphalt sector of the business.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Barrie Flitton, Operations Manager for Logistics at CEMEX, commented: \u201cKeeping our workers safe is a consistent motivation for us as we develop our business and the systems we use. We invested in the Blackline Safety System because of its superior functionality and usability, and the feedback from drivers has been so positive we are now keen to utilise this technology elsewhere. We want our drivers to feel confident and supported, whatever time of the day or night they are working.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">Dave, one of CEMEX\u2019s night-time drivers, added: \u201cI have worked nights for a few years now delivering to quarries and unmanned sites in the dark and I used to worry about my safety at times. For the last year we have been using the Blackline G7 and I feel so much safer at night now; I don\u2019t need to rely on someone to remember where I am and that I am on my own at an unmanned site. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\">\u201cThe system for me works very well and is simple to use. The pager is easily activated by me by the switch or if I fall it goes off automatically and I get a call from a manager or despatch through the device. The GPS is also much improved and we now have the ability to set off a silent or audible alarm if needed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\">Ends<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:10.0pt\"><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong> CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

        "Body": "<p>Based in the UK, Carbon8 Systems is a leader in the permanent capture of CO2 and mineralization of thermal residues to create carbon-infused, sustainable products. The company developed a patented chemical process called Accelerated Carbonation Technology (\"ACT\") where industrial residues are treated with captured CO2 emissions to transform them into valuable, low-carbon products.<\/p>\n\n<p>ACT has made significant contributions to the circular economy for more than 10 years, delivering commercial and environmental benefits that include diverting waste from landfills, permanently capturing CO2 and replacing carbon-intensive products with low-carbon, sustainable alternatives. ACT is applied to several industries, including cement, waste to energy, biomass, among others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both CEMEX and Carbon8 Systems recognize the benefit of mineralization as a carbon sink. Therefore, they may explore the application of the technology to different byproducts as well as the manufacturing of products such as alternative aggregates and supplementary cementitious materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under the initiative, Carbon8 Systems will evaluate CEMEX byproducts and how they can be used to develop low-carbon or even carbon-negative products through ACT. The initial focus of the program will be to assess byproducts from CEMEX's Rüdersdorf cement plant in Germany and Rugby cement plant in the UK. They will also evaluate the suitability of a lightweight aggregate product created from the byproducts for sale in each market. The program could later be deployed to other CEMEX cement sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"This initiative with Carbon8 Systems is another example of the work we are doing with partners across industries, academia, and startups to tap into the latest innovation and disruptive technologies to achieve our ambition of delivering net-zero CO2 concrete globally to all of our customers,\" said Juan Romero, Executive Vice President Sustainability, Commercial, and Operations Development of CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>John Pilkington, Chief Executive of Carbon8 Systems, said: \u201cWe are delighted that CEMEX has asked us to work with them; our carbonation technology, demonstrated at cement plants in Europe and Canada, offers CEMEX and the global cement industry a proven CCUS solution.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>This effort is part of CEMEX's roadmap for its ambitious climate action goals, including delivering globally net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050. This is one of several initiatives under the company's Future in Action program, which includes investing in promising technologies that the company will need to achieve its goal of net-zero concrete by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>About Carbon8 Systems<\/p>\n\n<p>ACT relies on a process of carbonation. This process occurs naturally under atmospheric conditions. If left in the open, compounds such as calcium or magnesium oxides, hydroxides, or silicates will react with the carbon dioxide. However, in nature, this process takes millennia. C8S\u2019 technology accelerates this process in a controlled way and in doing so, has created one of the worlds few economically-viable forms of carbonation and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU). The ACT process mineralises and stabilises these industrial by-products or residues to produce a granular solid. C8S\u2019 expertise around the carbonation process means that it is able to control the physical characteristics of the end-product. The end-product has various valuable applications, such as aggregates for construction, or agricultural fertiliser.<\/p>\n\n<p>The CO2ntainer system (a modular, containerised solution \u2013 carbon capture in a box) is similar in size to a shipping container so can be easily transported by HGV to site.<\/p>\n\n<p>John Pilkington has held a number of non-executive director roles and was previously a director of Ove Arup &amp; Partners and then Carillion plc and Amey plc for over 30 years.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2017, the company was awarded the Queens Award for Enterprise \u2013 Innovation, and its work has received support from Innovate UK and the State of Ontario in Canada.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Display Title": "CEMEX and Walsh River Freight Partnership to Reduce Transport CO2 by 75%",
        "Body": "<p>This contract will see Walsh running barges on the River Thames to transport aggregates from CEMEX\u2019s wharf at Dagenham to its readymix plant at Fulham with a 75% CO2 saving compared to road transport. It further demonstrates CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action commitment to net zero CO2, with an equivalent saving of more than 5,000 lorry movements.<br />\nMarine aggregates are processed at Dagenham and the site also receives limestone by sea from the company\u2019s Raynes Quarry in North Wales. Both materials are used in the Fulham plant to produce concrete that is supplied into the London market.<br />\nThis contract will transport CEMEX materials on the Thames with one barge service completed every day. The use of a river barge to transport these materials takes trucks off the road, helping to ease congestion and reduce emissions; each loaded barge carries 400 tonnes which saves the equivalent of 20 HGV lorries travelling across the centre of London.<br />\nThis contract with Walsh has been agreed as CEMEX prepares to invest in its Fulham Readymix site to ensure it can continue to meet demand for construction materials in the capital into the long-term. Opportunities to develop the partnership with Walsh further, including the identification of additional flows, are being explored.<br />\nDave Hart, CEMEX Supply Chain Director for UK and France, commented: \u201cWe are pleased to have agreed this new partnership with Walsh, who are perfectly placed to support us with the supply of materials into our Fulham site. We are always looking for ways to enhance the sustainability of our logistics operation, and the use of river freight supports our drive to be a responsible business by reducing congestion and air emissions in our great capital city.\u201d<br />\nLex Russell, Materials Director for CEMEX UK, added: \u201cOur Fulham readymix plant is a vital part of our London operation so it is important that it receives a consistent and reliable flow of materials from our Dagenham Wharf. Using the Thames provides a congestion-free, sustainable route through the centre of London and maximising the opportunities for river freight was encouraged in the Greater London Authority\u2019s strategic plan for the city.\u201d<br />\nJoe Gifford, Managing Director of Walsh, said: \u201cThis is a win-win, not just for CEMEX and Walsh, but also for freight transport, construction and the environment. Moving essential materials via the River Thames has numerous advantages \u2013 reducing lorry miles, less congestion, lower emissions \u2013 whilst at the same time helping to meet London\u2019s demand for materials for redevelopment and regeneration. We\u2019re proud to be working with the team at CEMEX to deliver that.\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

        "Body": "<p>The new Volvo FM 460 8x4 tippers, which will feature CEMEX\u2019s Future in Action branding, will work out of CEMEX\u2019s depot in Angerstein and be used to deliver aggregates and sand to construction sites across the capital.&nbsp;<br />\nThanks to their lightweight aluminium body, the business will be able to increase the amount of material transported in each load, while the engine meets the Euro 6 exhaust emissions requirements, which reduces nitrogen oxide (NOX) by 80% and particulate emissions by 50% compared with Euro 5. By investing in more efficient, more sustainable vehicles CEMEX demonstrates again its commitment to decarbonisation of all aspects of its operations, and the management of its logistics fleet is central to this.<br />\nThese vehicles all meet Transport for London\u2019s Direct Vision Standard (DVS) rating, thanks to their enhanced safety features. These include a side-scan system, while visual alerts are displayed on the windscreen if something is moving into the vehicle\u2019s danger zone.<br />\nFurthermore, each truck\u2019s cab features raised A-pillars that give it up to one extra cubic metre of space and more light. A large windscreen, low door line and modern mirrors ensures excellent all-round visibility which is improved further with an added lower window on each passenger door.<br />\nNigel Ponton, Fleet Engineering Manager for CEMEX UK, said: \u201cThe addition of these new trucks to our fleet will enable us to better meet customer demand, safely and efficiently. Safety is the number one focus whenever we add new trucks to our operation and these Volvos tick every box in that respect. One of the reasons why these vehicles stood out for CEMEX was because of the improved visibility and layout of the day cabs \u2013 providing an ideal workplace for our drivers whilst aiding the safety of other road users.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThese trucks will all be working in busy streets across London so it\u2019s imperative we provide our drivers with the best tools possible to do the job and help protect any vulnerable road users. Moreover, thanks to the improved fuel efficiencies and enhanced payload these new Volvos are the most sustainable vehicles we\u2019ve ever had and will help decarbonise our delivery footprint.\u201d<br />\nFor more information about CEMEX\u2019s sustainable logistics efforts, visit https://www.cemex.co.uk/sustainablelogistics.aspx&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>From energy efficiency and charging infrastructure investments to hydrogen trials, green tech and wetland restoration projects, today\u2019s report argues that low carbon and nature restoration projects can deliver key benefits in terms of employment, greater regional equality, long-term competitiveness and resilience.<br />\nThe briefing contains a wide range of case studies from Aldersgate Group members including Anglian Water, BT, Johnson Matthey, Legal and General Investment Management, National Grid, Scottish Power, Tesco, TLT LLP, Triodos Bank and the RSPB [2]. It follows a recent letter sent by over 200 business leaders to the Prime Minister calling for an economic recovery aligned with the UK\u2019s climate and environmental goals [3] and recommends key policies to deliver these types of projects on the ground.<br />\nReacting to the publication of the briefing, Nick Molho, Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, said: \u201cThere has rarely been a time when the economic, social and environmental agendas have been so closely aligned. It is clear from the case studies in our briefing that incentivising low carbon and nature restoration projects as part of the UK\u2019s recovery plan could do much to tackle economic and social concerns around jobs, regional inequality, long-term competitiveness and resilience.\u201d<br />\nToday\u2019s policy briefing argues that an economic recovery focused on stimulating low carbon and nature restoration projects could deliver key benefits, including:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>addressing regional inequality and unemployment;<\/li>\n\t<li>strengthening the UK\u2019s economic competitiveness and productivity through investment in the sectors and technologies of the future;<\/li>\n\t<li>delivering critical public goods, including clean air, better health and improved resilience to future environmental shocks;<\/li>\n\t<li>building a more resilient financial system fit to withstand future climate shocks;<\/li>\n\t<li>delivering the Global Britain agenda by strengthening the UK government\u2019s influence ahead of the G7 and COP26 summits that it will be hosting in 2021 and enabling UK businesses to be competitive providers of low carbon goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Nick Molho added: \u201cPutting an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at the heart of the UK\u2019s economic recovery need not be overly reliant on public money. Targeted public investment will be important to support early stage innovation in areas such as hydrogen and carbon capture but a lot of the heavy lifting can be done through the introduction of clear public policy signals to attract private sector investment in areas such as energy efficiency, charging infrastructure and natural capital projects.\u201d<br />\nPeter Simpson, Chief Executive, Anglian Water, said: \u201cThe need for economic recovery from Covid-19 in the face of the ever more pressing climate emergency presents business leaders not just with an opportunity to create a fairer, more sustainable future, but a responsibility to do so. I believe we can recover from this pandemic in a way that brings&nbsp;economic, environmental and social prosperity. We stand ready to work with government and our communities on a resilient, low carbon future that leaves nobody behind.\u201d<br />\nAndy Wales, Chief Digital Impact and Sustainability Officer at BT, said: \u201cAs we emerge from the crisis caused by Covid-19, government, businesses and policymakers must put action on climate at the heart of their efforts to revive the economy. BT is stepping up on climate action by backing new green technologies through our Green Tech Innovation Platform and by investing in the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure. We want to encourage and help others to do the same - creating a more sustainable, resilient, low carbon economy.\u201d<br />\nMartin Casey, Director Public Affairs Europe at CEMEX, said: \u201cAligning the economic recovery package with the UK\u2019s net zero emissions goal presents great opportunities for CEMEX. Reducing emissions is not limited to our production process but to the whole life cycle of our products and we have committed globally to reach net zero concrete by 2050. We are committed to continue reducing our direct and indirect emissions in our processes, both through the maximization of the traditional CO2 reduction levers and through implementing Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and other carbon innovative technologies. Our aim is to enable the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings and climate resilient infrastructures. Setting a clear policy direction for restarting the economy will enable the private sector to play its part in the recovery in a way that advances our climate and environmental goals.\u201d<br />\nSteve Andrews, CEO at Earthwatch Europe, said: \u201cIt is heartening to see so many organisations calling on Government to ensure a fairer, greener recovery post-COVID-19. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re listening. If COVID-19 and lockdown has taught us anything, it is the need to take science seriously and for Government to focus now, with urgency, on threats that seem beyond the electoral cycle.\u201d<br />\nAndy Walker, Technical Marketing Director at Johnson Matthey, said: \u201cAs this policy briefing outlines, the government has a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d to accelerate the transition to a low carbon and environmentally resilient economy as it develops and implements its strategy to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. Since the Climate Change Act was passed, the UK has successfully demonstrated that economic growth can go hand in hand with emissions reductions, further supporting the widely held view that measures which cut greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate the economy can be extremely effective in supporting jobs and<br />\neconomic growth. This \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d approach has the additional benefit of putting the UK on track to deliver our 2050 net zero commitments, strengthening our leadership and influence at the upcoming COP26 and G7 summits, as well as generating lasting social, competitiveness and resilience benefits.\u201d<br />\nAlexander Burr, Global ESG Public Policy Analyst at Legal and General Investment Management, said: \u201cThe UK government is faced with a unique opportunity to show that we are not returning to \u2018business as usual\u2019 through a recovery package that accelerates green economic growth. Over recent weeks, businesses and investors have been pledging their willingness and support for this agenda. The government should build on this foundation, bringing forward mandatory climate reporting and broadening its reach. Investors like LGIM<br />\nneed greater transparency and comparability from companies on their climate-related risks and opportunities, to direct capital into \u2018green\u2019 projects at scale. As we have seen lately, there is such a thing as being too late \u2013 it is time to act now!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power said: \u201cThere is now a compelling case for accelerating investment in a cleaner, greener society to deliver positive outcomes for both the economy and the environment. Positive outcomes that will benefit all of us thanks to cleaner power, cleaner home heating and cleaner transport. We must make our recovery green \u2013 delivering the much-needed jobs and investment that will get people, businesses, towns and cities back on their feet while cleaning up the environment and decarbonising the<br />\neconomy. The government cannot let this moment pass the country by.\u201d<br />\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be at the forefront of developing green infrastructure projects that will do just that. For example, partnering with Scottish Government and Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks to support the shift to electric vehicles in a way that will ensure fair and equal access for all. Developments like this will be a real game-changer in moving us closer to net zero \u2013 as well as supporting the economy \u2013 and that\u2019s why the two can, and must, go hand in hand. Only by doing that can we all achieve a cleaner and&nbsp;greener future \u2013 a better future \u2013 quicker.\u201d<br />\nMaria Connolly, Head of Clean Energy &amp; Real Estate at TLT LLP, said: \u201cThe positive impact that the last few months has had on the environment means that as we\u2019re looking forward the question that\u2019s being asked is, could a green recovery bolster the economy and accelerate our drive towards net zero by emphasising sustainable business practices and modern green industry over more traditional carbon intensive sectors? An economic recovery which places an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at its core would, without a doubt, also refocus growth, policy development and funding. While the backing of the financial sector is need to achieve this vision, for many banks and funders clean energy assets are still viewed as a stable investment, and if you consider the upscale in clean energy generation \u2013 an estimated 90GW of wind energy, 80GW of solar power and 30GW of energy storage - that will be required to achieve net zero then this represents an exciting opportunity to drive economic growth by creating jobs and developing local supply chains based on clean energy.\u201d<br />\nBevis Watts, CEO of Triodos Bank UK, said: \u201cWe now have a window of opportunity, as we seek to overcome the challenges of the coronavirus crisis. A recovery should seek to increase resilience across all areas of society and focus on shaping a more inclusive and low-carbon economy. Triodos has always been a pioneer in sustainable finance \u2013 most recently we have been looking at linking the economic and societal benefits we take for granted from nature to real investment in its restoration. We need collaborative action to develop an economy linked to societal health and environmental limits and require a financial sector that proactively looks for solutions to achieve that. Simply a move to avoiding harm is not enough.\u201d<br />\nJulia Barrett, Chief Sustainability Officer at Willmott Dixon, said: \u201cWe welcome this briefing from the Aldersgate Group, and believe that putting an ambitious environmental and climate agenda at the heart of the recovery will ensure that the UK economy is more competitive in the long-term whilst being more resilient to future risks. We believe that by investing in a nationwide retrofit programme supported by clear policy signals, government could deliver rapid localised job creation, whilst addressing the social&nbsp; inequalities associated with fuel poverty and poor health associated with living in cold homes. This is an essential step on our journey to net zero emissions as 80% of the buildings that will exist in 2050 are<br />\nhere now.\u201d<br />\nDarren Moorcroft, CEO of the Woodland Trust, said: \u201cA resilient economy and society require a resilient environment. This welcome work by the Aldersgate Group shows how vital&nbsp;it is that we seize this moment and ensure that actions to reboot the economy set us firmly on the road to net zero and show world leading ambition when it comes to restoring our natural environment. Protecting, restoring and expanding native tree cover \u2013 with all the social, economic and environmental benefits that will bring - belongs at the heart of any \u2018green recovery\u2019 worthy of the name. The Woodland Trust has a powerful record of delivery and stands ready to play its part - working alongside business, government and our NGO partners to help transform our nation into a better place for people and wildlife.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>\u2014ENDS\u2014<br />\nNotes to Editor<\/strong><br />\nThe Aldersgate Group is an alliance of leaders from business, politics and civil society that drives action for a sustainable economy. Our members include some of the largest businesses in the UK with a collective global turnover of nearly £550bn, leading NGOs, professional institutes, public sector bodies, trade associations and politicians from across the political spectrum. Our mission is to trigger the change in policy required to address environmental challenges effectively and secure economic benefits for the UK in doing so.<br />\n[1] The Aldersgate Group launces a new policy briefing today, Seize the moment: building a thriving, inclusive and resilient economy in the aftermath of COVID-19. The report will be available here:&nbsp;https://www.aldersgategroup.org.uk/latest#low-carbon-projects-are-a-key-solution-to-jobs-inequality-and-resilience-concerns&nbsp;<br />\n[2] The briefing provides an overview of a wide range of case studies and projects from Anglian Water, BT, Johnson Matthey, National Grid, Scottish Power, the Teeside Collective, Tesco, TLT LLP, Triodos, Legal and General Investment Management and the RSPB. This briefing will soon be followed by in-depth economic analysis from the London School of Economics commissioned by the Aldersgate Group, setting out what should be the key pillars of the UK\u2019s economic recovery plan.<br />\n[3] On 1 June 2020, around 200 business leaders \u2013 including several Aldersgate Group business members - wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and called for an economic recovery plan aligned with the UK\u2019s net zero target and other environmental goals.

Canning supplied and installed the new conveyor system, which included a 20-tonne hopper feeder, a number of field conveyors and a radial stockpiler.<br />\nAs we move into the next phase of extraction this will minimize the use of diesel-powered dumpers; saving a projected 300,000 litres of fuel per year, the equivalent of taking 172 cars off the road. There will also be decreased dust and noise at the quarry.<br />\nSteve Sheller, CEMEX\u2019s Head of Business Development for West Europe Materials, commented: \u201cSwinderby is a crucial site in our portfolio; it supports our customers in the Birmingham metro-market and wider Midlands area, and has a considerable reserve potential of more than 10 million tonnes.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are therefore investing heavily into the site to ensure it can meet demand for years to come, while also achieving the sustainability targets set as part of our Future in Action global strategy. By using a conveyor we can considerably cut CO2 emissions \u2013 we\u2019ve calculated a ~50% reduction in CO2 per tonne of aggregate, when comparing to the anticipated consumption to work the next phase of the quarry using mobile plant, alongside further efficiency and cost savings. Taking into account forecasted production figures this is a total CO2 saving of approximately 74%.\u201d<br />\nAdditionally, a new processing plant is being installed at Swinderby, which will nearly double the site\u2019s production capability. This investment is due to be completed early 2023 and together with the new conveyor system will futureproof the site and enable continued supply to the key Midlands market, while meeting increased customer demand. Further investment opportunities for the site are also being explored around renewable energy sources.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about CEMEX visit www.cemex.com&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

The strategy involved a challenging audit process and complete change of culture amongst our employees,\u201d commented Andy Spencer, Director of Sustainability and Energy. Once each site had been audited and the results analysed, the right bins and skips for the right waste to minimise landfill and maximise recycling were put in place. With the right facilities on each site, a campaign highlighting environmental and financial benefits for better waste management was implemented to engage employees. Andy concludes: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have achieved it without the commitment of everyone in CEMEX UK.&nbsp; They have really embraced the whole initiative.&nbsp; It is now everyday practice for them to recycle and divert waste from landfill. Before Recycle R8 we had 27% waste diverted away from landfill today it is 80%, with us moving towards our 100% target.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"

Using ReadyBlock Zero and ReadyBrick Zero products would reduce the CO2e by around 70% so would take this down to around 4,200 kg \u2013 a significant reduction in emissions, especially if used for multiple buildings in one development. The remaining or residual CO2e would then be offset.<\/p>\n\n<p>ReadyBlock Zero Light and ReadyBrick Zero Common Brick are zero carbon concrete products which look identical to traditional concrete blocks and bricks, with the only difference being that they embody up to 80% less carbon, with the remaining carbon offset to make a CarbonNeutral product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. To do this CEMEX is working with Natural Capital Partners, an award-winning expert on carbon neutrality and climate finance, that is harnessing the power of business to create a more sustainable world.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ReadyBlock Zero range is part of CEMEX\u2019s VERTUA family of low carbon and sustainable Urbanisation Solutions and is available for projects across the UK, ahead of the Government\u2019s Future Homes Standard \u2013 when all new homes must produce 75-80% less carbon emissions by 2025.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Carl Platt, Urbanisation Solutions Director of Asphalt, Paving and Building Products for Europe, commented: \u201cThe initial launch of our ReadyBlock Zero dense concrete block was very well received, with customers asking us to expand our range further to include lightweight and common brick options. I\u2019m proud of the way we have quickly responded to feedback and now offer these two additional products nationwide. Together, they can present significant savings on emissions \u2013 imagine how much of a difference could be made to the carbon footprint of the construction industry if the ReadyBlock Zero and ReadyBrick Zero products were used for every new home built!\u201d<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s Climate Action strategy aims to lead the way in the construction industry and has an overall global ambition of delivering net zero carbon emissions in concrete by 2050. CEMEX Urbanisation Solutions is constantly innovating to provide customers with a broad range of sustainable solutions for the challenges of urbanisation, with a central focus at all times on the Future In Action strategy - committed to Net Zero CO2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about our low carbon concrete bricks, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/low-carbon-masonry-blocks\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/low-carbon-masonry-blocks<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 475kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 40% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction*<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 55% in clean energy consumption<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX:<br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

This product achieves a 70% reduction in embodied carbon emissions, with the remaining unavoidable emissions offset through working with Natural Capital Partners, a carbon offset and carbon neutrality specialist.<\/p>\n\n<p>To contribute towards the 70% reduction, CEMEX is introducing a new innovative geopolymer cement solution, which was developed at its Global Research &amp; Development Centre in Switzerland and can be used in certain applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to Vertua ultra zero, the range also features other low carbon concretes which can be used in a wide range of applications and include an option for customers to choose the added benefit of offsetting the residual CO2.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua line of low CO2 products was originally launched by CEMEX in France in July &nbsp;2018, and following its success, the offer has now been introduced to the UK and complemented by the offsetting option to deliver net zero carbon concrete. In line with our 2050 ambition, the range will be gradually extended to other geographies in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>After engineering carbon reductions into the concrete mix design, CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon generated from extraction and processing of raw materials, product manufacturing and distribution. The residual carbon is then offset, making the concrete CarbonNeutral from cradle-to-customer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carbon offsetting is the removal or reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX will facilitate this by investing in projects which physically remove CO2 where possible from the atmosphere, such as planting more trees or protecting against deforestation through an independently audited and verified project. A CarbonNeutral certificate is then issued to the client.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is working with Natural Capital Partners, experts in carbon offset solutions, to assure the quality of the emissions reductions, which also deliver added benefits such as increasing biodiversity and reducing poverty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Michel Andre, VP Materials Western Europe for CEMEX, commented: \u201cConcrete is an essential part of construction \u2013 it is cost effective, versatile and typically made from local materials. Concrete is vital for the infrastructure that helps provide the UK with clean water, sanitation and energy, as well as durable homes, schools, hospitals, travel networks and much more.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cHowever, we recognise future construction needs to be balanced with the effect it is having on the environment. We at CEMEX know that we can best meet these challenges by working in partnership with our clients and stakeholders to develop solutions together. We continually invest and innovate to become an environmentally friendly, sustainable leader\u2014enabling a low-carbon and resource-efficient circular economy.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Andy Spencer, VP Corporate Affairs, Sustainability &amp; ERM for CEMEX Europe, added: \u201cWe are really proud to introduce Vertua, the UK\u2019s first CarbonNeutral® ready mixed concrete product. By offering a range of low and \u2018zero\u2019 carbon concretes, including the ability to offset the current residual CO2, we aim to make it easy for clients to make the vital transition to more sustainable choices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe know that carbon offsetting is only an interim measure while we further develop technology that is still in early stages. At present we believe it is a good way to sequester the remaining CO2 from our lower carbon solutions to take important climate action now. We are sure this will prove a relevant solution as the construction sector looks to take rapid action to improve the sustainability and climate impacts of the built environment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Climate change has been a global priority for CEMEX for many years and has brought significant progress to date. But there is a need to do more and faster. This is why CEMEX has recently announced a more ambitious climate strategy, including a new global target for CO2 emissions by 2030: a reduction of 35% to ensure alignment with the Paris Agreement commitments. This is in addition to the ambition of delivering net zero concrete globally by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX calculates the embodied carbon in the Vertua range using a Carbon Footprint Calculator (CO2 Tool) that follows the principles of PAS2050.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Vertua range of low carbon concretes will be formally launched in the UK at Futurebuild 2020 on CEMEX\u2019s stand (F70), held between 3rd \u2013 5th March at ExCeL London.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Interview opportunity<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX will be launching Vertua at the 2020 Futurebuild exhibition.

        "Body": "<p>Of this, over 1.3million tonnes has been supplied to our external customers; 1million tonnes was for CEMEX\u2019s nearby concrete plants, predominantly those at Rotherham, Barnsley and Attercliffe itself; and finally more than 200,000 tonnes has been used by CEMEX\u2019s Asphalt business.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThis milestone figure demonstrates the strategic importance of the rail operation to the CEMEX business in the UK. The aggregate travels to Attercliffe from the Dove Holes quarry in Buxton, Derbyshire, and the use of rail offers considerable efficiency benefits; taking trucks off the road and reducing carbon emissions. A train burns significantly less fuel per ton-mile than road vehicles, saving around 50 per cent in CO2 emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nDavid Hart, CEMEX\u2019s Supply Chain Director for UK &amp; France, commented: \u201cThis is an incredible milestone for Attercliffe railhead, and proves how safe and effective rail can be when transporting aggregates. Most deliveries into this site take place at night, allowing us to make the most of every hour of the day and showing that CEMEX never stops when it comes to fulfilling orders and ensuring exceptional service for our customers.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n\u201cUsing rail to transport aggregates is an area of our business that continues to grow and is a real focus for us, as we look to decrease road congestion and cut carbon emissions by reducing our number of truck movements. Congratulations to Steve Taylor, plant manager, and the team at Attercliffe for this achievement \u2013 we look forward to more than doubling this tonnage over the next ten years!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe railhead at Attercliffe is operated in partnership with DB Cargo UK, and generally receives larger locomotives with 24 wagons, carrying a load of 1,850 tonnes per train.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAndrew Sumner, Head of Industrial Sales at DB Cargo UK, said: \u201cBy combining our expertise in rail freight with CEMEX\u2019s expertise in aggregates, we have forged a strong and successful partnership over the years, ensuring a first-class service for the UK construction industry.<br />\n\u201cFar from being just a \u2018hook and haul\u2019 provider, we pride ourselves on offering a complete one-stop shop for all rail services, including transportation, terminal management and materials handling.

        "Body": "<p>The club was looking for a sand which could increase the grip for horses while on the pitch, enhancing performance, and offer better drainage. The sand needed to allow horses to run safely and comfortably during damp conditions, helping their hooves to grip to the grass. It was also important for the sand to feature a good particle size distribution and bury itself into the grass.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nIn addition to the 3,000 tonnes initially provided, a further 2,500 tonnes will be provided to the club before the end of the year, with the same total quantity required annually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nneogem\u2019s sports sand pro was identified as the best sand to meet the club\u2019s needs. This high-quality sand has been certified, tested and approved by the Sports Turf Research Institute (STRI). It is washed prior to delivery to ensure a fine, soft finish.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nTracey Taylor, neogem sales representative, commented: \u201cIt was a real privilege to work with Cowdray Park Polo Club as they prepare for this year\u2019s Gold Cup. neogem\u2019s sport sand is the ideal product for such a world-class polo pitch; helping the horses to perform and the pitch to retain its reputation as an incomparable setting for a premier polo tournament.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n\u201cOne of the key challenges for this project is to work around the British weather; sand can only be spread when it is dry and not too windy. This meant a close working relationship was needed with the club to ensure we could supply at short notice and can also continue to do so throughout the season as repairs and top-ups to the pitches are needed.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nJulian Russell Hayes, Grounds Manager at Cowdray Park Polo Club, added: \u201cWe need our polo pitch to be at its best for the Gold Cup and choosing the right sports sand is a key part of this. We are very happy with the neogem product and the service provided during purchase, delivery and installation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe premium aggregates available from neogem are now available in selected countries across Europe, and are fast building a reputation as luxury, high performance products that can be relied upon, particularly in the sports sector.

        "Body": "<p>The traditional ceremony took place at the Damen Shipyards Galati in Romania, and was attended by representatives from both CEMEX and Damen.<br />\nMark Darren Williams, fleet engineering manager for CEMEX, commented at the ceremony: \u201cFor CEMEX UK Marine, its management and personnel, today is a milestone in our company history. This new ship represents a significant investment and the first new vessel both in the CEMEX fleet and that of the UK aggregate industry in over 20 years. Today we convert a lot of hard work, technical drawings, calculations, ideas, energetic discussions and exchange of point-of-views, into a physical floating object, by the highly skilled women and men of Galati and Mangalia.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe CEMEX Go Innovation is the first of Damen\u2019s new Marine Aggregate Dredger class, a 103.5 metre MAD 3500. The vessel is the result of close cooperation between CEMEX and Damen and represents the first of a new generation of efficient and economical dredgers specialising in the extraction of sand and gravel from the seabed. It is designed to extract aggregates from the sea bed up to depths of 55 metres, including in the challenging conditions experienced in the North Sea.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe CEMEX Go Innovation has been developed to offer major environmental savings while ensuring safety, high performance and sustainability. The result is a dredger which will have a 25% increased capacity, nearly double the dredging depth and discharge rate increase of 20%. Further design features include optimal balance between payload and efficiency, overall length of 103.5 metres, a deadweight of just under 7,000 tonnes and a maximum loaded speed of approximately 12 knots.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nFollowing its launch, the CEMEX Go Innovation will complete its fitting out with commissioning due to begin at the end of the year, and delivery expected in the early spring of 2020.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nLaurence Dagley, managing director, CEMEX Materials UK Southern, commented: \u201cIt was very exciting to see our state-of-the-art dredger, CEMEX Go Innovation, and participate in the traditional launch ceremony with Damen. This is a ground-breaking ship that leads the industry thanks to the major environmental savings that it offers, its increased capacity and dredging depth, and its safety-enhancing external pipework. We look forward to the CEMEX Go Innovation arriving in the UK and beginning its work early next year.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nKurt Cowdery, director of CEMEX Marine, added: \u201cCEMEX GO Innovation is a state-of-the-art vessel that will allow us to further enhance our Marine profile and capability in both the UK and Europe. &nbsp;We continue to stay ahead of our competitors and are maximising the opportunities available to us. We would like to thank all that have been involved with this project, in particular the Marine team. This is an excellent investment in our people, business and future!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n\u201cThe cooperation between Damen and CEMEX UK Marine has been really excellent,\u201d said Damen\u2019s Joppe Neijens, sales manager dredging for north, west and south Europe. \u201cIt has been a very smooth process and we have built the vessel together, using the original Damen MAD concept as the basis for a vessel optimised to meet the needs of CEMEX. They challenged us to meet their requirements and as a joint team we made it happen. This new dredger will differentiate itself from the current fleet and set a new standard in the industry. As such, the CEMEX Go Innovation represents the start of a new era. I can\u2019t wait to see the vessel sailing.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ends.<\/p>\n\n<p>About CEMEX<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>CEMEX is a global manufacturer of building materials and the biggest Mexican investor in the UK, with 3,000 people employed across 450 sites nationwide.

        "Display Title": "CEMEX develops technology to accurately measure concrete\u2019s resistance during setting",
        "Body": "<p>With more precise and real-time information about the concrete hardening process, builders may remove the formwork, or molds, at precisely the right moment and make informed decisions about the concrete mix they use in their projects. These decisions can result in time and cost savings and potentially a reduction in the carbon footprint of a project because real-time information on the product mix would reduce unnecessary use of cement, which has a higher carbon footprint. Through an optimized concrete composition, a specific jobsite like a tunnel or bridge can achieve a CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;reduction of up to 13%, for a given level of strength.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cSpider Tracker is a true innovation for the building materials industry and another way we are providing a superior customer experience by putting new technology at their reach,\u201d said Fernando A. González, CEO of CEMEX. \u201cThis latest achievement is further proof of our commitment to sustainability and the success of our Digital Innovation in Motion program.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Spider Tracker\u2019s sensors are placed in fresh concrete to measure its temperature at various points during the setting process. That information is relayed to thermo-tracking cylinders built with the same concrete mix as the project and exposed to the same temperature through special containers. These cylinders recreate the hardening process at the same rate as the poured concrete, replicating resistance with more precision than other methods commonly available. By testing their resistance, builders may determine when their structure has reached its desired compressive strength.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other real-time monitoring technologies for concrete are based on a mathematical predictive formula. These traditional technologies may be off by up to 80% in their estimation of a structure\u2019s actual compressive strength. Spider Tracker has proven to be accurate by up to 95%, a game-changing innovation that gives the most accurate data available in the market.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To provide accurate information, Spider Tracker uses a thermographic camera to place the sensors in the coldest points of the structure. The technology also allows recording, controlling, and viewing of the entire process from a mobile application.<\/p>\n\n<p>Spider Tracker is specially made for large-scale projects such as bridges and multi-story buildings that require expensive pieces of formwork that need to be removed and reused. The technology has been shown to reduce construction times by as much as 40% in real-world tests. It has been used in the construction of the Science Building at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, Colombia. It is currently in the process of being scaled into new geographies.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is actively driving innovation in the construction industry by unlocking new value opportunities for its current and potential customers while boosting its internal innovation and efficiency. CEMEX\u2019s Digital Innovation in Motion program encompasses CEMEX\u2019s innovation efforts in its commercial offering, back-office processes, and smart manufacturing. The Spider Tracker technology is the result of work done by the company\u2019s global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by the CEMEX Research Center based in Switzerland. Spider Tracker\u2019s proprietary technology is patent pending.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX is a global construction materials company building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>CEMEX has agreed to provide its expertise in concrete technology, chemical admixtures, and special aggregates to design a specialty mix that is lightweight, resistant to ocean conditions, and lower carbon, facilitating a floating foundation with a reduced CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;footprint. CEMEX will also support the consortium with technical assistance in the industrialization and supply chain of concrete for the project.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to be part of this groundbreaking renewable energy pilot. Vertua concrete was created specifically to enable ambitious low-carbon projects such as this one,\u201d said Fernando A. González, CEO of CEMEX. \u201cThis project demonstrates our continued commitment to sustainability and innovation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The consortium is led by ESTEYCO, a leading civil engineering and architecture consulting firm with over 50 years of global experience that developed a proprietary technology named Wind Hybrid Esteyco Evolution for Low-carbon solutions (WHEEL). One element of this technology replaces traditional steel used in floating platforms with lightweight, lower-carbon Vertua concrete.<\/p>\n\n<p>The European Commission\u2019s climate targets for 2030 and 2050 rely on an ambitious strategy that that promotes the development of clean energy such as offshore windfarms in Europe\u2019s five sea basins. The WHEEL project seeks to enable this ambition.<\/p>\n\n<p>The consortium includes leading companies such as 2-BENERGY, BOSKALIS, ROVER MARITIME, TENERIFE SHIPYARD, BRIDON-BEKAERT, VICINAY, PLOCAN, FIHAC, and EnBW. With the financing support of the European Commission, the consortium will work to install a 6MW 2-bladed downwind turbine on the WHEEL platform near the Canary Islands in Spain by 2025.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project aligns with CEMEX\u2019s flagship Future in Action program, which seeks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. A key element of Future in Action is innovation and partnerships, participating in projects such as this with other companies working to mitigate climate change.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX (NYSE: CX) is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Global building materials supplier CEMEX has signed The Pallet LOOP Charter, which aims to reduce waste in the construction industry through a national pallet reuse scheme that supports the principles of the circular economy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The Pallet LOOP challenges unsustainable supply chain practices by allowing manufacturers to pay a deposit to use Pallet LOOP\u2019s highly durable distinctive green branded pallets, which are 100% FSC-certified.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As LOOP pallets move through the supply chain, a deposit passes from manufacturer to merchant to end user. Once used, stacked and stored, the scheme operator collects the pallets and returns deposits, before repairing pallets as necessary and recirculating them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Graeme Barton, National Sales Manager, Packed Cement, CEMEX added: \u201cAnnually, around 18 million pallets are estimated to be used in the UK construction sector, but only 10% are reused. The Pallet LOOP presents us with a solution that is better for business and better for the planet. We will have a far greater impact if we are all pulling in the same direction. We need the whole supply chain onside, because clearly the smallest change in process can have the biggest impact over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cAdditionally, The Pallet LOOP philosophy underpins CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action strategy, which focuses us on our critical 2050 decarbonisation targets by making changes that can be implemented right here and now, today. We are committed to working towards a circular economy and proud to be part of the collective that has signed The Pallet LOOP charter.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Paul Lewis, Founder of The Pallet LOOP, said: \u201cAs the only circular economy pallet supplier to the UK construction sector, our aim is to create a legacy of lasting change that accelerates the elimination of avoidable waste, repurposes pallets, and continuously improves safety.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo galvanise support for The Pallet LOOP, we created a charter for construction industry players to sign to make clear their commitment to considering a more sustainable solution for the movement of building materials. By signing The Pallet LOOP charter, our signatories have acknowledged, individually and collectively, that now is the time for change. Discussions are now moving forward apace across the industry and The Pallet LOOP is targeting early 2023 for the roll out of our green pallets throughout the building materials supply chain.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX\u2019s Future In Action programme is pioneering ways to increase the use of waste and residues as alternative raw materials and fuels.

This commitment aligns with the company\u2019s ambitious goals of reducing transport carbon emissions by 30% by 2030 and becoming Net Zero by 2050, part of its Future in Action program to achieve sustainable excellence and become a net zero CO2 company.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">This commitment is particularly challenging since zero-emission heavy-duty transport is unavailable at scale. At the panel, Fernando A. Gonzalez talked about how collaboration and innovation are at the core of our efforts. CEMEX is already piloting fully electric concrete mixer trucks with partners like Volvo. CEMEX is also investing in transition technologies such as natural gas, replacing 200 diesel trucks with this lower-emission alternative earlier this year.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">CEMEX TO HOST DISCUSSION PANEL<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Additionally, on Thursday, November 10, CEMEX will host the discussion panel <b>Working Together to Decarbonize the Construction Value Chain<\/b>, where a high-level group of experts will discuss critical levers and innovation strategies for fully decarbonizing the construction value chain.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Moderated by Thomas Guillot, Chief Executive of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), the panelists will include Diane Hoskins, Gensler Co-CEO, Fernando A.

In addition, the company expects significant demand in the Industrial & Commercial sector with onshoring and the redefinition of trade relationships due to supply chain constrains and geopolitical tensions. Mexico, Europe, and the US are particularly well-positioned to take advantage of the reshoring trends.

        "Body": "<p>\u201cIn the past three years, our business has proven its immense resilience in the face of a global pandemic, historic inflation, and supply chain disruptions,\u201d said CEMEX CEO Fernando González. \u201cI am incredibly proud of how we have navigated the extraordinary developments of the last few years. With the highest inflation in 40 years, we have been successful in recovering costs in dollar terms. In 2023, however, we must develop our pipeline of growth projects while we continue our efforts to recover margins as some cost headwinds, particularly in Europe, are still ahead of us. Our growth, climate action, and digital strategies, coupled with our Urbanization Solutions business will provide a strong base for growth over the medium term.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX has weathered inflation with a bold pricing initiative that has more than offset inflationary costs in dollar terms, but high inflation and supply chain headwinds have delayed its ability to regain margins. In the US, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes $110 billion dollars of incremental spending for highways and streets, the most cement-intensive portion of infrastructure. In Europe, the \u20ac750 billion from the Recovery Fund to invest in green technologies, clean energy and transportation, renovating buildings, and upgrading digital infrastructure, is expected to also be an important driver for building materials. In Mexico, the onshoring phenomenon is expected to drive demand for manufacturing and industrial construction in the medium-term.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX also announced at its CEMEX Day the goals of its new 2030 roadmap. The aggressive 2030 goals include a 47% reduction<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;in CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;per ton of cementitious material and a commitment to reach 65% consumption of clean electricity by 2030. Additionally, for the first time, CEMEX has set ambitious goals for Scope 3 emissions, showing CEMEX\u2019s commitment to decarbonize its entire value chain.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur products are essential for the wellbeing and development of humanity, and I am convinced that the transition to a net-zero industry is feasible,\u201d added Mr. González. \u201cMoreover, the journey to decarbonization can be profitable, as our customers reward those companies that are leaders in this global transition.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, CEMEX became one of the first companies in the cement industry to have its 2030 decarbonization targets verified by the Science Based Targets initiative for alignment with their 1.5°C scenario, the most ambitious scenario available to the industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vertua, the CEMEX\u2019s portfolio of sustainable and lower carbon products, is the linchpin of its contribution to decarbonizing the built environment and building a better, more sustainable, future for all. One of the most accepted lower carbon products in the industry, Vertua has seen strong adoption across CEMEX\u2019s markets. The company expects Vertua lower carbon products to account for the majority of its cement and concrete sales by 2025.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX launched its Future in Action program in March of 2021 to build a more sustainable, circular future, with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;company. Since then, the company has achieved record-breaking CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;reductions, and its performance to date has given the company the confidence that it can achieve a more accelerated pathway for 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX committed to the following 2030 goal vs. a 2020 baseline:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Reduction in scope 1 emissions of 31% per ton of cementitious material.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction in scope 2 emissions of 58% per ton of cementitious material.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of scope 3 emissions of 25% per ton of purchased clinker and cement.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of scope 3 emissions for 40% per ton of purchased fuels.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of 42% in absolute scope 3 emissions from the use of traded fuels.<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduction of 30% of scope 3 emissions from upstream transportation and distribution per ton of materials transported.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><br />\nCEMEX (NYSE: CX) is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

The agreement enables CEMEX to leverage Leilac\u2019s highly efficient direct separation technology, to capture CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;at a low cost in its operations.<\/li>\n\t<li>A US Department of Energy-funded FEED study in collaboration with the independent nonprofit research institute RTI International, to develop a large-scale carbon capture system at CEMEX\u2019s Balcones Cement Plant in Texas. Other partners on the project include SLB, a global technology company and the licensor for RTI\u2019s NAS solvent capture technology. The study will perform an engineering design for a commercial-scale system able to capture 670,000 metric tons of CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;per year, with a carbon capture efficiency above 95%.<\/li>\n\t<li>A partnership with leading global CCUS research institute TNO to work on one of the most comprehensive carbon capture, utilization and storage studies in the industry. The study will include eight CEMEX cement plants in Europe, Mexico, and the US, focusing on synergies and creating an environment that brings the industry closer to implementing CCUS at scale.<br />\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Future in Action is CEMEX's program to achieve sustainable excellence through climate action, circularity, and natural resource management with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;company.

        "Body": "<p>This new edition illustrates the urgent need to harness the potential of natural ecosystems to mitigate climate change, given their ability to capture and store carbon safely over the long term.<br />\nWritten by renowned international conservationists and illustrated with amazing images from world-renowned photographers, \u201cNature\u2019s Solutions to Climate Change\u201d focuses on the critical importance of natural ecosystems\u2014particularly primary forests, mangroves, and peatlands\u2014to achieve greater carbon emissions reduction and to help solve our global environmental crisis.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<em>\u201cIt is urgent to maintain the integrity of natural ecosystems, and not to disturb those that are still in good condition. Currently, we know that intact ecosystems store more carbon safely and in the long term because they are more resilient. These days, global leaders are gathered at the COP25 Climate Summit in Madrid, engaged in very real discussions to address the effects of climate change and to fulfill the commitments we all set as signatories to the Paris Agreement. That is why this year\u2019s book is of such immediate importance, as it underscores the considerable potential of natural ecosystems to fight climate change,\u201d<\/em> said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nSince 1993, CEMEX has published a new book every year, blending extraordinary photography and informative content to guide its global audiences and reinforce its commitment to promoting a culture of biodiversity conservation. This year's volume is published in conjunction with Conservation International, Global Wildlife Conservation, Sea Legacy and, Wild Heritage.<br />\n\u201cWith the 27th edition of our Conservation Book Series, \u201cNature's Solutions to Climate Change,\u201d we alert our global audience to the urgent need to conserve, protect, and rehabilitate our natural ecosystems so they maximize their potential to store CO2. With global emissions still on the rise, this volume emphasizes the critical need to harness the full potential of natural solutions to mitigate climate change effectively,\u201d concluded Vicente Saiso, Corporate Director of Sustainability of CEMEX.<br />\nIn addition to raising public awareness through this series of books, CEMEX carries out different actions across its worldwide operations to combat climate change and promote the digital economy:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The reduction of emissions and the use of alternative fuels. Reducing net CO2 emissions per ton of cement by 21.6% and avoiding the generation of almost eight million tons of CO2 during 2018 compared with the company\u2019s 1990 baseline. We have a target to further reduce our emissions by 30% by 2030, in line with the science-base targets methodology for our sector.<\/li>\n\t<li>The restoration and conservation of biodiversity in its operations. Storing 23.5 million tons of CO2 naturally in its quarries, of which 96% had a current environmental rehabilitation plan in place at year-end 2018.<\/li>\n\t<li>The management and protection of El Carmen Nature Reserve. This extensive over 140,000-hectare wildlife preserve, equivalent to the size of Mexico City or Houston, Texas, captures around 11 million tons of CO2 naturally in its plant mass.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you want to know more about the latest edition of CEMEX Nature and Conservation&nbsp;Book Series, \u201cNature's Solutions to Climate Change,\u201d please visit the following link:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cemexnature.com/libro/natures-solutions-to-climate-change/\">http://www.cemexnature.com/libro/natures-solutions-to-climate-change/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Participants Information<br />\nConservation International uses science, policy, and partnerships to protect the nature that people rely on for food, fresh water, and livelihoods.

Funded by CEMEX UK and organised by Groundworks East, the project took place between March and October 2022 with Green Lanes Primary School, St. Philip Howard Primary School, Birchwood Avenue Primary School, Oakview Primary School and Onslow St. Audreys Secondary School. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">All five schools are based in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The schools were chosen due to their proximity to CEMEX\u2019s Hatfield quarry. The programme for all schools included a visit to Hatfield quarry and Amwell Nature Reserve, and two classroom sessions. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The project was a great success; it gave the children opportunities to learn about industry on their doorstep and provided them with \u2018real life\u2019 examples, through exploring and comparing a working quarry to a quarry which had been restored as a nature reserve. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The children took part in activities such as fossil making, bird watching, sketching and role playing and debates. The activities allowed the children to: learn about local industry and the process of quarrying; learn about local wildlife and the impact on the environment from quarrying; and gain knowledge about local geology and the formation of fossils. The children took a great interest in learning about their local area as shown by their enthusiasm to research further into the topic at home and in school. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The project has proved to be very popular with local schools that see it as a great way of meeting many requirements of the National Curriculum.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Here is some of the feedback from the participating schools:&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">\u201cThe children from Green Lanes have loved their visits to CEMEX quarry and Amwell Nature Reserve. It has allowed them the opportunity to experience different environmnents that some may not have been able to experience before. They were able to see first hand the impact of quarrying and the resulting positive impact it can have. This helped bring their learning to life and spark a range their enthusiasm to learn more and ask questions.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>"

It was connected directly to the mains electric supply for the offices and would automatically kick in should a power cut occur, this made its recovery challenging in terms of timing and safe disconnection. A big thanks to Peter Finney from our Rugby Cement plant for its safe disconnection following the relocation of our IT servers to Coventry, which gave us a tight window of opportunity before the building was handed over. The generator has been relocated within the Aggregates division just down the road from Rugby at Berkswell Quarry, replacing a currently hired unit. This provided an annual saving of over £12,000 and is a great example of working together as One CEMEX.<\/p>\n\n<p>A big thanks to Natasha Page for coordinating the operations along with everyone else involved in organising these donations.

Recognising the significance of this extraordinary discovery, Kent County Council enlisted specialist support and emergency funding from Historic England.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over 100 timbers from the ship's hull were recovered, with dendrochronological analysis funded by Historic England, dating the timbers that built the ship to between 1558 and 1580 and confirming it was made of English oak. This places the ship at a transitional period in Northern European ship construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The story of the rare ship featured on Digging for Britain, with presenter Alice Roberts in the studio with Wessex Archaeology marine archaeologist, Andrea Hamel, and Antony Firth, head of marine heritage strategy at Historic England.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can watch the episode on BBC iPlayer&nbsp; (from 21:40mins) Read more about it: https://www.wessexarch.co.uk/news/rare-elizabethan-ship-discovered-quarry-300- metres-coast<\/p>\n\n<p>Photo: Archaeologist records the ship\u2019s remains on-site.
