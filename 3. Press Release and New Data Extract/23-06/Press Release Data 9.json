        "Body": "<p>VIALOW Zero, supplied by CEMEX\u2019s Liverpool Docklands asphalt plant, was selected by the Council for Lark Lane, Liverpool. A vibrant hub of the city on the edge of the historic Sefton Park, Lark Lane is home to many popular local boutiques, bars and restaurants. With combined high-density pedestrian footfall and road user traffic, a continuous stream of round-the-clock access is required on Lark Lane, with businesses facing directly onto the busy street.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Working with Dowhigh Contractors, the use of warm asphalt (VIALOW) not only reduced CO2e, but also lowered the impact of construction fumes during the re-surfacing, creating a better environment for local residents, pedestrians, and Dowhigh\u2019s contractor workforce throughout the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Liverpool County Council were also able to reduce the total time needed for traffic restrictions and road closure, with VIALOW as the asphalt reaches the appropriate trafficking temperatures faster than conventional hot mix asphalt. The re-opening of Lark Lane was fast-tracked as a result, minimising the overall disruption to the immediate local community and busy road users, as well as car fumes from stationary queuing cars. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Alongside the reduced carbon in the mix, Liverpool County Council chose to offset the residual CO2e to make it a CarbonNeutral product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. &nbsp;By offsetting the residual CO2e from the 284 tonnes of asphalt used for the project, 16 tonnes of CO2e was offset; the equivalent of the emissions generated by the annual electricity use for 24 homes on Lark Lane for a year.&nbsp;<br />\nVIALOW is a range of low temperature, low carbon asphalts from CEMEX. A specially formulated bitumen additive is used to enable manufacture at up to 40°C lower than standard asphalt mixes with no compromise in performance, and the added benefit of achieving up to 20% reduction in embodied carbon emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Allan Jones, Head of Business and Strategy, Dowhigh commented: \u201cThe Lark Lane project was successfully completed with CEMEX, using VIALOW, which helped us save 16 tonnes of carbon. This project will hopefully be the beginning of a determined move to make our roads greener and more sustainable for the future.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Pete Hoare, CEMEX\u2019s Asphalt Area Manager, added: \u201cWe want to make it easier for local authorities and councils to specify lower carbon solutions. As a result, we worked closely with Liverpool County Council to provide a hardworking solution that not only reduced CO2e, but also the impact on the local community environment as well.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cStationary vehicles at traffic lights on road closures can create 4 times as many pollutants, when compared to moving vehicles, so it\u2019s really important that we help to minimise traffic restrictions and the resulting car fumes, whilst roads are being maintained and repaired. Vialow is the optimum asphalt solution to increase overall productivity in restricted areas, whilst significantly saving CO2e to drive forward the government\u2019s low-carbon economy by 2050.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>VIALOW belongs to the Vertua® family of sustainable building materials now offered by CEMEX as part of its commitment to enhancing the environmental credentials of its operations.

        "Body": "<p>Regenera leverages CEMEX\u2019s substantial international footprint and the ability of its production processes to use non-recyclable waste and industrial by-products as more sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels and natural raw materials.<br />\nRegenera is actively working on several major projects across the EMEA region:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>In France, Regenera operates a multiservice dock located in an industrial harbor in Paris offering a wide range of circular economy services to the construction industry. The company receives a variety of materials, including construction debris, excavated material and inert soil, which it sorts, processes, and transforms into recycled aggregates or inert material used to restore quarries.<\/li>\n\t<li>In Egypt, Regenera has signed a three-year agreement with the NGO Very Nile to support waste removal efforts from the Nile River. The recovered non-recyclable materials will be used to substitute fossil fuels at CEMEX\u2019s Assiut cement plant, with other materials being recycled or upcycled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Additional projects are also underway in CEMEX\u2019s wider global business. In Mexico, Regenera is already processing almost two million tons of waste streams per year, and is now working with the government of Mexico City on its \u201cZero Waste Plan\u201d. Meanwhile, in Colombia, Regenera has signed an agreement to work with Tetrapak, to receive and separate multilayer cartons at its facility and return those that can be reused or recycled.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Regenera aims to serve a diverse client base which includes industrial, manufacturing, construction and waste collection companies, NGOs, and governments. Regenera provides sustainable solutions for three major waste streams: municipal and industrial, construction, demolition, and excavation (CDEW), and industrial byproducts.&nbsp;<br />\nSergio Menendez, Regional President for CEMEX EMEA, commented: \u201cGrowing a circular economy is a key pillar of our dedicated climate action strategy, Future in Action, as it not only reduces waste being sent to landfill, but also helps to preserve natural resources and reduce emissions. The launch of Regenera is therefore the latest step in our efforts to be a net-zero CO2 company globally by 2050.<br />\n\u201cWe believe that CEMEX and other companies in the building materials industry can be a major contributor to a more circular society, and our role in utilising waste and byproducts is key to a greener economy.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s Future in Action programme is pioneering ways to increase the use of waste and residues as alternative raw materials and fuels. At the forefront of the circular economy in the construction value chain, CEMEX is committed to achieving true carbon neutrality.<br />\nFor more information about CEMEX\u2019s Future in Action strategy, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/future-in-action\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/future-in-action<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About CEMEX:<\/strong><br />\nCEMEX is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>tEnergy converts biomass and non-recyclable waste into a lower-carbon energy solution, which can be used in the short-term as a fossil fuel alternative or be upgraded in the medium- and long-term to gases such as biomethane or pure hydrogen. CEMEX intends to incorporate this clean energy source into its clinker and cement manufacturing process, looking to further reduce the carbon footprint of its operations. CEMEX aims to increase its fossil fuel substitution rate by 20 percentage points by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis investment aligns with our strategy to find innovative clean fuel and energy sources for the cement industry,\u201d said Gonzalo Galindo, Head of CEMEX Ventures. \u201cWe have outlined an ambitious rollout strategy across multiple operations, starting with Spain and other European countries before expanding to other international markets\u201d.<\/p>\n\n<p>This investment is part of CEMEX's Future in Action program to build a more sustainable, circular future, with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;company. Since the launch of Future in Action, the company has achieved record-breaking CO<sub>2<\/sub>&nbsp;reductions. Innovation is a key component of the program.<\/p>\n\n<p>Alternative fuels are an important lever of CEMEX\u2019s ambitious 2030 decarbonization roadmap, which has been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative for alignment under their new 1.5ºc scenario, the most ambitious pathway defined for the industry. One of the main levers for achieving its targets is using alternative fuels with high biomass content.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About WtEnergy<\/strong><br />\nWaste to Energy Advanced Solutions (WtEnergy) was born in 2017 thanks to 20 years of experience of its founder Andrés Ponce on gasification, biofuels and clean energy generation (thermal and electric).

While we are progressing important carbon capture projects and policy advocacy for our ultimate net zero target, these 2030 interim aspirations are not reliant on this technology.\u201d<br />\n\u201cThis is certainly a challenging target, but I am confident that with innovative thinking, close collaboration between our different business areas, and further development of our regulatory framework, it is both feasible and profitable. This sustained effort is vital if we are to meet our global, primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050. We will continue to provide regular updates on our progress.\u201d<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s European cement operations were able to achieve the substantial CO2 emission reduction in 2022 thanks to significant developments in its climate action activity, including a large investment in a new alternative fuels facility in the UK, investment into solar energy at sites in countries including Germany and Poland, plus increasing supply of its more sustainable Vertua products across the region.<br />\nThe business\u2019s European cement plants have worked hard to reduce emissions, with CEMEX Spain signing an important agreement to ensure 30% renewable energy supply for its cement plants, while the region has also seen a reduction in clinker factor along with an increase in the use of alternative raw materials that lower the carbon footprint of the process.<br />\nCEMEX\u2019s global Future in Action strategy recognises that the opportunity for reducing emissions is not limited to the production process but to the entire life cycle of its products, as well as transforming the industry\u2019s value chain.

This will also provide transparency to stakeholders as we execute on our sustainability roadmap, deploying exciting projects to contribute to the decarbonization of the construction industry,\u201d said Maher Al-Haffar, CEMEX's Chief Financial Officer and founding member of the UN Global Compact CFO Coalition for the SDGs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Framework is aligned with the ICMA and LMA Green Bond and Loan Principles 2021, according to the second-party opinion issued by Sustainalytics. Consistent with CEMEX\u2019s commitment to transparency, all its stakeholders will have the ability to assess progress on the allocation of all net proceeds related to the Framework and their environmental impact through CEMEX\u2019s Integrated Report annual update.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Framework and Sustainalytics\u2019 second-party opinion can be found in the following link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cemex.com/en/investors/debt-information/sustainable-finance#navigate\">https://www.cemex.com/en/investors/debt-information/sustainable-finance#navigate<\/a><\/p>"

This was an issue as CEMEX is not the landowner and access is required to the wharf edge by Stevedores, ship\u2019s crew and ABP staff.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">Nigel explains: \u201cI remembered a visit I had to Concrete Products at Wick as part of my role and business familiarisation back over 19 years ago, when I had a tour of Wick Products with Sue Townsend. I was aware of multiple sites in Readymix and Aggregates that had previously sourced \u2018lego blocks\u2019 externally at a significant cost and used them for demarcating areas. I remembered from my visit to Wick they used to have waste concrete moulds. I spoke to Sue who willingly agreed to start producing the Jersey blocks for us at Swansea.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif\">The blocks were delivered and put in place by a local haulage contractor, FG Bond, who Wick Products used.

        "Body": "<p>\"Reincarnate\" is a research and development project focused on issues related to the circular economy and seeking to develop technical and social measures that give new possibilities to buildings, building products and materials - thus maximising their life cycle and determining whether they are suitable for reuse.&nbsp;<br />\nTogether with partner Mostostal Warszawa, CEMEX is developing solutions to extend the life cycle of a building and thus reduce construction and demolition waste. The goal is also to develop digital tools i.e., BIM to track materials, manage CDW (Construction and Demolition Waste) and reduce CO2. &nbsp; PLGBC, the Polish Green Building Association, is also a partner in Poland.<br />\nToday, construction and demolition waste (CDW) accounts for up to 30% of all waste generated in the European Union. Although more than 75% is recycled, there is still a lot of valuable material ending up in landfill. In the long term, the innovations developed in the project are estimated to reduce construction waste by 80% and reduce the CO2 footprint by 70% in the construction sector.<br />\nThe Reincarnate project will develop the Reincarnate Circular Potential Information Model (CP-IM) platform. The data collected in the CP-IM will then serve as a source of technological innovation in areas such as building control and inspection, construction and dismantling planning, and CSD identification and classification.&nbsp;<br />\nThe Reincarnate project will focus in particular on developing the required social innovations that will allow for the widespread application of circular concepts. The social innovations to be developed will be at the intersection of social-behavioural and economic solutions.<br />\n\u201cWe are very proud to see our operation in Poland join the Reincarnate project alongside businesses from across the world. We believe that collaborating with innovative businesses and industries is vital if we are to achieve our goal of operating as a net-zero organisation by 2050. We are excited to see what is developed as part of this partnership, and the positive impact it will have on the more sustainable construction solutions available to our customers,\u201d commented Ruediger Kuhn, VP Materials Central Europe CEMEX.<br />\n\u201cCEMEX Poland actively supports all initiatives whose goals are consistent with our global climate strategy \"Future in Action.\" An example of such an initiative is the ambitious \"Reincarnate\" project, under which we intend to develop, among other things, concrete products with a low carbon footprint and the possibility of using recycled aggregates. We plan as well as digitising our processes and the information we provide, i.e., creating a materials database for the BIM model and digital delivery documents for our products. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cWe are pleased that through our involvement in this venture we can share good practices and ideas with both Polish and foreign partners, as well as learn from their knowledge and experience. We are convinced that our cooperation will result in many innovations that will benefit the European industry in the future,\" says Michał Grys, Director of the Materials Division, Member of the Management Board at CEMEX Poland.&nbsp;<br />\nThe \"Reincarnate\" project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101056773.<br />\nThe project is scheduled for completion in May 2026.<br />\nMore information about the project: <a href=\"https://www.reincarnate-project.eu/\">https://www.reincarnate-project.eu/<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nAbout CEMEX&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX is a global building materials company that cares about a better future for future generations through sustainable products and solutions.

These attributes have been identified in line with Cemex\u2019s dedicated climate action strategy, Future in Action, which targets operation as a net-zero company globally by 2050.<br />\nAny products to bear the Vertua brand must meet strict criteria for at least one of these sustainable attributes, with the benefits clearly and transparently presented for customers on a fact label. These new labels also fulfil the function of promoting the most technical part of each attribute and will be applied on assets including packaging, websites and brochures.<br />\nThe launch of this updated brand portfolio has now begun in Cemex\u2019s European business. It starts in France this week, where the company is appearing at the Low Carbon World exhibition in Paris on the 5th and 6th April. Deployment will continue across the region, with all countries anticipated to have integrated the new brand into its operation by June.&nbsp;<br />\nSergio Menendez, President of Cemex EMEA, commented: \u201cCemex is attuned to the need to focus on all aspects that can make a product more sustainable; not just achieving a lower carbon footprint. With the updated classification system for Vertua, customers can now more easily identify which of our products leverage the cutting-edge technology and innovation that will enable them to overcome the challenges they are currently facing in construction and renovation, such as thermal regulation of buildings, soil permeability and conservation of natural resources.<br />\n\u201cThe enhanced Vertua brand represents a more ambitious and stronger approach: from a group of low carbon products to a family of products and solutions that encompass more sustainable attributes and contribute to our company vision of building a better future.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\nThis extension to the Vertua brand is the latest development from Cemex, which continues to act as pioneers in more sustainable solutions for its customers. It comes shortly after the business announced a milestone 41 per cent reduction* in the CO2 emissions generated by its European cement business in 2022. Cemex expects to exceed its 2030 aspiration of hitting a 55% CO2 reduction in its European operations.<br />\nVertua's goal is to be positioned as a brand that offers a comprehensive and crucial range of environmental attributes; from lower energy to use of recycled materials; expanding its field of action and strengthening its sustainability credentials.&nbsp;<br />\nFor more information, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/future-in-action\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/future-in-action<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>* Compared to 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nCemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

The experts of Cemex are pleased to advise interested parties on the application possibilities and explain the technical details.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concrete with recycled aggregates contains aggregates from professionally processed mineral construction waste, essentially concrete fragments that have been brought to the required particle sizes in crushers and impact mills - concrete is a material that can be recycled again and again. Concretes with recycled aggregates are subject to the same requirements as conventional ready-mix concretes and show identical fresh and hardened concrete properties.<\/p>\n\n<p>By expanding its offer with concretes with recycled aggregates, the building materials company is adapting its product mix to customer needs and strengthening the circular economy: with their recycled constituents, concrete with recycled aggregates contributes actively to the conservation of natural resources.<\/p>\n\n<p>The concretes with recycled aggregates for the Berlin metropolitan market are part of the Vertua® product family, Cemex's global brand for products with sustainable attributes, comprising ready-mix concretes, cements, aggregates, and admixtures. Furthermore, Cemex launched in early 2023 Regenera, a brand that provides circularity solutions.

Organiser Rob Greenfield, UK Planning &amp; Development Manager, commented: \u201cIt rained heavily the days before the event so mud and puddles played a bigger part than some of us were expecting. We\u2019ve certainly all evolved fitness wise over the whole COVID period and so it was lovely to be able to just enjoy a run together again. The event itself was very friendly and well organised, it\u2019s certainly one I\u2019d like to come back to.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>The group are now thinking about the next event and with the lighter evenings coming intend to use Binley office as a base for the occasional after work runs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Team Cemex was represented on the day by (photo R-L): Jane Walsh, Clare Pickering, Laurence Dagley, Rob Greenfield, Paul Bradshaw and Clare\u2019s partner Steve.<\/p>"

        "Summary": "Cemex has made a considerable investment into its UK rail network, making improvements at several of its depots across the country. These developments support Cemex\u2019s efforts to increase the use of rail to move its materials, as part of its Future in Action sustainability strategy.",

        "Body": "<p>Work was carried out at Cemex\u2019s Dove Holes, Selby and Bletchley depots, with a particular focus on improving health &amp; safety and efficiency through track and walkway upgrades. This work was all completed in partnership with MLP Railway Maintenance Ltd, Cemex\u2019s chosen provider for these developments.<br />\nAt Selby in North Yorkshire, upgraded track means the site can take an increased number of wagons per train, and complete turnarounds more efficiently and safely. Meanwhile, at Dove Holes in Buxton, two reception lines were relayed. This was a significant project which required considerable planning and coordination with Network Rail, as the site runs adjacent to the main line. &nbsp;<br />\nFinally, the team collaborated with Network Rail again at Bletchley in Milton Keynes, to implement improved walkways, CCTV and a waterproof display screen for offloading. This allows ground staff to watch the process from outside of the discharge area, reducing noise and dust exposure. &nbsp;<br />\nThese three development activities were supported by smaller walkway improvements made at other Cemex rail depots, including Crawley and Stourton. The walkway improvements were completed in collaboration with Network Rail\u2019s Freight Safety Improvement Portfolio and helped to improve the walkways adjacent to Cemex\u2019s that Network Rail is responsible for. Cemex works to an established industry track and walking route standard to ensure a safe and reliable operation for its employees and contractors, while reducing the risk of derailments. &nbsp;<br />\nMark Grimshaw-Smith, Rail and Sea Manager, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to invest in our rail heads across the UK. This not only ensures that the safety and wellbeing of those who work on our sites is enhanced on an ongoing basis, but it also provides further resilience in the operation, transporting more materials by train and thus taking more trucks off the road.<br />\n\u201cClose collaboration with Network Rail was vital during this project as we worked alongside the mainline, and we are grateful to them and our own local teams for their support. We also ensured minimal impact to customers thanks to a robust supply chain management process.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nFor more information, visit: www.cemex.co.uk&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cemex:<\/strong><br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Coloured discs were then laid out to visualise this, with the children were encouraged to share photos of the demonstration with their parents.<br />\nFinally, the children were given the opportunity to sit in the driver\u2019s seat for a driver\u2019s-eye view, which was a popular activity! All children were all given child-sized high visibility vests, reflective slap bands, and a fun educational road safety leaflet as mementos of the occasion.<br />\nDarrell Collins, Driver Trainer and Assessor for Cemex UK, commented: \u201cCemex was very proud to have this opportunity to provide vital road safety education to children in our local community. Working with vulnerable road users such as children to ensure they better understand the risks associated with HGVs is something we are passionate about and an integral part of our health and safety strategy. Incorporating hands-on activities that enable the children to see from the driver\u2019s perspective are hugely valuable and make a real difference to how they act around trucks when they come across them in real life. &nbsp;<br />\n\u201cThe success of these events has prompted us to continue this awareness-raising with more schools in the area, with further outreach sessions in the pipeline.\u201d<br />\nFor more information about Cemex\u2019s pedestrian safety activities, visit: <a href=\"https://www.cemex.co.uk/pedestrian-safety\">https://www.cemex.co.uk/pedestrian-safety<\/a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>CEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Cemex\u2019s VIALOW, VIAFLOW®, and VIACOURT® asphalt, plus newer products that use a lower carbon bitumen, now form a new series of high-performance asphalt solutions which have been stringently classified to join the Vertua® product family, as part of Cemex\u2019s Vertua® brand expansion programme.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>All Cemex products which carry the Vertua® brand must meet strict criteria for at least one of five sustainable attributes ranging from lower carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency, water conservation, through to incorporating recycled materials and design optimisation. These attributes have been identified in line with Cemex\u2019s dedicated Future in Action climate action strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>VIALOW is a low temperature, reduced carbon asphalt which comes with the option to offset residual CO2 to make it a CarbonNeutral® product, in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol. VIALOW\u2019s specially formulated bitumen additive enables manufacture at up to 40°C lower than standard asphalt mixes with no compromise in performance, and the added benefit of achieving up to 20% reduction in embodied carbon emissions. Cemex\u2019s lower temperature asphalt solutions are enabled by the company\u2019s technically advanced admixtures capabilities, a further differentiating lever that enables Cemex to continue leading the path in developing innovative, more sustainable solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s latest lower carbon asphalt innovation, features a new bio-component binder which locks carbon into asphalt. This reduces the carbon footprint of the bitumen by up to 250 kg of CO2e when compared with conventional bitumen, which in turn reduces the CO2e in the asphalt by as much as a third. The solution involves the addition of biogenic components engineered to ensure bitumen compatibility that won\u2019t compromise the performance characteristics of asphalt. The end-result is an asphalt that can be recycled whilst also retaining captured bio-carbon in the long term.<\/p>\n\n<p>VIAFLOW® is a range of permeable asphalt mixes with a highly durable, free draining surface, which allows water to pass through to the underlying structure or drainage system. Rated highly for its water management properties, VIAFLOW® is suitable for use as part of a designed Sustainable drainage system (SUDS), either through distribution to ground/drainage or for use in 'greywater harvesting' applications. VIAFLOW properties can be further enhanced when forming a system with Cemex\u2019s Permaflow permeable concrete, ensuring an optimal solution for surface and storm water management.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>VIACOURT® is an optimum asphalt material designed and engineered for use in high performance sports surfaces. Designed to provide a rapid draining surface for tennis courts and other sports surfaces, VIACOURT® allows sport to recommence soon after periods of rain fall.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Scott Jones, Director of Asphalt and Paving Solutions for Cemex EMEA, comments: \u201cOur comprehensive range of Vertua® asphalt solutions allow customers to measure the sustainable impact of their projects because the attributes are now verifiable. This can be reflected both in the product manufacturing process and in the useful life of the project. Vertua®\u2019s single-minded ambition is to extend its value to all products in Cemex\u2019s portfolio, leveraging cutting-edge technology and pioneering innovation to help clients meet their construction needs more sustainably.\u2019\u2019<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nVertua® asphalt solutions are integral high-performance products offered by Cemex\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions Europe business.

The lower carbon concrete will be trialled at the airport in a pouring site under the watch tower as part of a phased process to test its strength and durability in the field. The project, led by Jacobs and implemented by Cemex and Ecocem will see the lower carbon concrete assessed for use in main airport areas, groundworks and auxiliary purposes.<br />\nWith aircraft taking off and landing every 45 seconds pre-pandemic, it is critical the concrete undergoes rigorous testing to ensure its strength and durability can withstand the pressures of the one of the world\u2019s busiest airports. The aim is for the trial\u2019s findings to be used to set out a blueprint that other airports, keen to reduce carbon from all facets of their operation, can follow.<br />\nRichard Kershaw, Technical Manager at Cemex said: \u201cCemex is renowned across the construction industry for its commitment to providing customers with more sustainable concrete solutions. We were the first supplier in the UK to launch a net-zero concrete product, making us ideally situated to support Heathrow with their lower carbon concrete trial. We hope this trial will prove successful and demonstrate to the aviation sector the opportunities available to cut emissions during their development projects.\u201d<br />\nNigel Milton, Chief of Staff and Carbon at Heathrow said: \u201cHeathrow is once again serving as a testbed for ground-breaking technologies, demonstrating global leadership with regards to sustainable travel. We\u2019re committed to cutting carbon emissions on the ground as well as in the air and we\u2019re delighted to be hosting one of the first airport trials in the world to test lower carbon alternatives. I hope that this trial will help radically transform the built environment at Heathrow in the years to come.\u201d<br />\nMark Till, UK National Sales Manager at Ecocem, said: \u201cOur technical solutions have long helped large scale infrastructure projects to reduce carbon emissions across Europe. Having the opportunity to partner with Heathrow airport on a project with huge potential in the UK and for the aviation sector is a testament to the innovation of our products and team. We look forward to working with Heathrow and our other partners to begin this trial.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\nRichard Moore, Europe Aviation Engineering Lead at Jacobs said: \u201cJacobs are delighted to have been the technical consultant on the Low Carbon Concrete initiative at Heathrow since its inception in 2018. The trial is an exciting milestone in the development of lower carbon infrastructure solutions at the airport. It is the culmination of four years of research and planning towards these initial trials which will form the foundation of further work exploring other lower carbon products and materials. Testing the materials in a range of airport infrastructure applications, not just runway and taxiway pavements, allows us to maximise the opportunity to reduce embedded carbon in a wide variety of concrete types. Building on the success of the trial, we look forward to upscaling to usage in airfield projects being delivered by Ferrovial Construction, Dyer and Butler and other major programme partners across the airport.\u201d &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nThis trial at Heathrow Airport is the latest example of Cemex\u2019s commitment to fostering partnerships with forward-thinking organisations as part of its efforts to achieve true carbon neutrality, in line with the Future in Action program.<br />\nFor more information, visit: www.cemex.co.uk &nbsp;<br />\nCEMEX R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 165kg, equivalent to a 35% reduction.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of waste per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

        "Body": "<p>Funded by both Liverpool City Council and British Cycling, an underused part of Everton Park has been transformed into Liverpool\u2019s first purpose-built children\u2019s learn-to-ride facility. The £380,000 \u201cMini-Roads\u201d scheme was delivered by highways contractor Dowhigh Ltd, working in close partnership with Cemex and Shell Construction and Road to realise the partnership\u2019s first successful largescale application trial of Shell\u2019s Bitumen CarbonSink, a new bio-component binder which locks carbon into asphalt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Shell Bitumen CarbonSink reduces carbon footprint by up to 250kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of bitumen. The solution involves the addition of biogenic components engineered to ensure bitumen compatibility that won\u2019t compromise the performance characteristics of asphalt. The end result is an asphalt pavement that can be recycled whilst also retaining captured bio-carbon in the long term.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As well as reclaiming and recycling existing materials onsite to re-use in the new road construction, Cemex\u2019s Rubbermix asphalt was supplied. Rubbermix transforms used tyres into new valuable roads, helping to offset the environmental impact of highway maintenance activity through the circular economy. With one tyre per tonne of asphalt, Rubbermix offers the potential to recycle up to 500 tyres per kilometre of road, depending on layer thickness.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scott Jones, Director Asphalt and Paving Solutions EMEA, Cemex, comments: \u201cEverton Park\u2019s new cycle track surface features a ground-breaking technical carbon sink, creating a hard wearing asphalt road surface for thousands of future road users to enjoy for many years to come. &nbsp;With no compromise on quality or longevity, the new asphalt road is recyclable, and most of this carbon will not re-enter the atmosphere, even at the end of its life. Cemex is particularly keen to proactively support projects promoting sustainable urban mobility and is committed to reducing environmental impact by lowering the carbon footprint and increasing circularity \u2013 Everton Park has provided the perfect opportunity to showcase our expertise in this field.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Nikhil Subedi, Environmental Sustainability Officer, Dowhigh comments: \u201cEverton Park is a modern park on an historic site with an important community legacy. The Everton Park P2R Mini Road is an example of how we can tackle the issue of carbon emission in road construction. We want to make it easier for local authorities and councils to regenerate and maintain urban spaces like these with lower carbon solutions. Technical innovation to accelerate the decarbonisation of the construction and road sector is critical \u2013 working with Cemex and Shell\u2019s Bitumen CarbonSink has enabled us to deliver on our mission to maintain the quality and integrity of our roads and highways, whilst driving the circular economy to lower CO2e, reduce waste and create cleaner, more sustainable environments.\u201c &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The half kilometre long Mini Roads track has been expertly designed to imitate a realistic road lay out, with junctions and crossings. As well as new surface works, the new facility includes new asphalt and soft-play surfacing to provide an all-year round community asset.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mini Roads was recently officially opened to the public and the community and key stakeholders came together to celebrate the launch. The not-for-profit community organisation Peloton Liverpool, instrumental in the concept and realisation of the project, will be launching a programme of cycle sessions at the facility over the next five years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Asphalt containing Shell Bitumen CarbonSink will be offered to future customers as part of Cemex\u2019s Vertua family of products and solutions. The Vertua lower carbon product symbol is awarded to selected Cemex products characterised by their unique raw material composition, which contains the highest quality ingredients to reduce the carbon footprint of the finished product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex aims to be the partner of choice in sustainable urbanisation and indeed this asphalt supply is the latest example of Cemex providing Liverpool City Council with more sustainable solutions, following on from the road re-surfacing programme at Lark Lane last year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex\u2019s Climate Action strategy \u2018Future in Action\u2019 aims to lead the way in the construction industry with an overall global ambition of delivering net zero carbon emissions by 2050. One of the key Future in Action pillars is precisely aimed at partnering with leaders in their respective fields, such as Liverpool City Council and Shell, to lead the path in the sustainability journey of the built environment. Asphalt falls under Cemex\u2019s Urbanisation Solutions product portfolio, which is determined to become the industry\u2019s trusted partner of choice in addressing the main urbanisation challenges more sustainably.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Image credit: Stratus Imagery<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.

Having the fences&nbsp;painted, the railings cleaned and painted has a huge visual impact to everyone who walks into the&nbsp;playground.

        "Body": "<p>BPD is ideal for use on farmland due to its high potassium and lime content meaning it can provide a direct sustainable replacement for traditional fertilisers and lime.&nbsp;<br />\nAdditionally, by re-using BPD, Cemex has been able to dramatically reduce the amount of process by-product it landfills; this figure is now zero.&nbsp;<br />\nContributing to the circular economy is a key pillar of Cemex\u2019s climate action strategy Future in Action, which has set a global target to become a net zero company by 2050. In addition, recovering BPD supports Cemex\u2019s 2030 target to increase the ratio of waste derived sources managed versus waste sent for disposal.<br />\nPaul Fletcher, Head of Sustainability for Cemex Europe, commented: \u201cWe are very proud of our partnership with Silverwoods and the considerable positive impact their innovation and expertise has had on our ability to reuse BPD for other applications. We believe it leads the way in our industry and presents real potential to be adapted elsewhere across our operation; not only does it benefit the environment by reducing the amount of materials that need to be disposed of, but it generates a product that has a value for farmers and helps cut the use of traditional materials.&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cIndeed, the value of this partnership demonstrates that to deliver true circularity, more industrial by-products, including those from different sectors of the economy, need to be used as secondary resources, rather than primarily be seen as waste. If this is to be achieved, a new perspective is needed to boost circular economy practices, with regulations and permitting supporting this proactively.\u201d<br />\nTo further explore the benefits of using Cemex\u2019s BPD in an agricultural setting, Silverwoods has funded two Research and Development PhD studies. The first identified the agronomic benefits of the land application of By-Pass Dust (BPD) while the second, which is currently ongoing, attempts to calculate how much carbon can be captured and sequestered from the land application of BPD through Enhanced Rock Weathering and also via improved crop performance.<br />\nThis research was recently recognised at the Eco Innovation North West Awards at the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester organized by Lancaster University, winning the Carbon Journey Award.<br />\nJulian Silverwood, Managing Director, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to win this recognition from Eco-I North West. Our work with Lancaster University has been a huge success in helping us understand the full carbon sequestration potential of cement bypass dust when applied to agricultural soils. It has validated that there is huge potential for the use of industrial waste to establish negative emission solutions, which is good for the environment and contributes to the UK\u2019s aim to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\u201d<br />\nFor more information, visit: https://www.cemex.co.uk/<br />\nCemex R&amp;D, Innovation and Business Development projects are part of the global R&amp;D collaboration network, headed by CEMEX Research Centers, based in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Ends-<\/p>\n\n<p><br />\nNotes to Editors:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cemex announced its Climate Action strategy; \u2018Future in Action \u2013 Committed to Net Zero CO2\u2019 in February 2020, along with updated targets in November 2022 and as part of this, by 2030 it plans:<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be below 430kg of CO2 per ton of cementitious material, equivalent to a 47% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce the carbon content per cubic meter of concrete to 150kg, equivalent to a 41% reduction*.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach 65% in clean electricity consumption by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To reduce Scope 3 transport emissions by 30% by 2030.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For Vertua lower-carbon to account for majority (50%+) of cement and concrete sales by 2025.<br />\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To manage up to 40M tons of circular materials per year by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>* According to our 1990 baseline<\/p>\n\n<p>About Cemex:<br />\nCemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions.
